0,American Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,6.2,9415,11365,1950,Moderate,Yes,"  American Lake is located 3.1 miles from Castle Creek Road in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It lies near treeline at the top of Devaney Creek in a narrow, high-walled valley.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	American Lake and Cathedral Lake are often referenced together because of proximity, however the trails and final destinations are fairly different. 	The American Lake Trail is distinguished by longer stretches of aspen and near-constant tree cover, while Cathedral is more open with steeper climbs through treeline. American Lake is an ideal choice for active families, runners and seeing autumn colors:   The trail enters the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness and turns up into a thick aspen forest. It winds and climbs steadily through tall aspen and a verdant grass-flower understory, gaining over 800' in just the first mile (1.0 miles : 10,250'). 	It straightens up the Devaney Creek valley and abruptly transitions from aspen to spruce-fir (1.35 miles : 10,545'). Timber breaks across a large glade at the base of a steep open slope, a great place to see wildlife (1.5 miles : 10,650'). 	Travel moderates back into the forest, dipping and rising to a second open slope (2.45 miles : 10,970'). The trail is a little more rugged through cluttered stretches to consecutive openings across scree slides (2.75 and 2.95 miles). 	It continues on a mild grade to the edge of American Lake (3.1 miles : 11,365'). American Lake is bound by steep walls and loose rock on two sides which limit exploration, but the east side is level, thinly treed and easy to maneuver about. Social trails lead through the area to good campsites, and large portions of the shore are easy for anglers to access.

1,Capitol Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,13.2,9468,11597,2129,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," Capitol Lake (11,597') is located 6.6 miles from Capitol Creek Trailhead in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. It fills a steep-walled bowl framed by Capitol Peak (14,130'), Mount Daly (13,305') and Capitol Pass (12,078'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail drops 400' in .68 miles from Capitol Creek Road to the valley floor, where it turns south beside Capitol Creek and follows it through long intervals of aspen, meadow and airy alpine landscapes to the lake. There are marked connections for Nickelson Creek Trail, Capitol Ditch Trail and West Snowmass Trail, and unmarked climbing routes that split off to Mount Daly and Capitol Peak. The main trail continues .8 miles past Capitol Lake to the pass and drops SW into the Avalanche Creek drainage. Camping is only permitted at designated sites around the lake, and campfires are not permitted at these sites (stoves only). Dispersed camping and campfires are otherwise permitted in the MB-SM Wilderness leading up to the lake (see Camping and Backpacking for details). Capitol Creek Trail sees heavy use, especially on summer weekends. Arrive early to secure choice campsites and avoid congestion on Capitol Creek Road (see important driving notes below): There are two trailheads in the main parking lot - find Capitol Creek Trail and begin a fast descent through mountain shrublands to the valley floor. Flowers are particularly abundant on this sunny, south-facing slope. The trail crosses Capitol Creek on a bridge (.68 miles : 9,070') to the Wilderness Boundary (.7 miles) and Nickelson Creek Trail split (.72 miles : 7,097'). It rises away into thick aspen and curls south on high banks over the creek with good views of open slopes across the valley. The trail crosses a creek (2.15 miles : 9,370') and rises steadily through aspen, glades and brush to a large meadow at 3.0 miles (9,840'). It cuts across the base of this steep meadow to the Capitol Ditch Trail split (3.32 miles : 9,940'), a scenic area along the creek ideal for fishing. The trail continues south through attractive meadows to the West Snowmass Trail split, which comes in from the left (3.9 miles : 10,145'). It crosses a big meadow then steepens into a cluttered forest and passes through a grazing allotment boundary gate (4.4 miles : 10,305'). Travel eases across a meadow (4.75 miles : 10,475') before another steep push up an E-W dogleg and tight switchbacks that lead to a creek at 5.55 miles (10,960'). The trail is potentially vague here but easy to find once across. It continues on a shifting climb through an expanding alpine landscape to the Designated Campsite - Fire Restriction sign (6.17 miles : 11,360'), past which it funnels up a steep gully that opens to big alpine meadows at the Capitol Lake - Capitol Pass Trail split (6.45 miles : 11,563'). Designated Campsite spurs can be found between the gully and this sign. Follow signs left that crest over a scree pile down to Capitol Lake (6.6 miles : 11,597'). The lake is hemmed by steep walls comprised of loose rock - be mindful of falling/sliding rock around the shore. Scale walls and knolls for a better look, or hike up toward Capitol Pass for great views over the basin. Capitol Pass is .8 miles and 510' up from the split to the lake. It's a little easier to backtrack on the established trail than negotiate steep loose rock around the lake to pick it up.

2,Cathedral Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,5.6,9880,11866,1986,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," Cathedral Lake is located 2.8 miles from the Cathderal Lake Trailhead south of Aspen, CO. It fills a large bowl ringed by Malamute Peak (13,348'), Cathedral Peak (13,943') and Leahy Peak (13,322'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery This short but feature-filled hike follows Pine Creek through aspen forests into the upper valley, where the landscape opens over treeline up to the lake. Those with time and agreeable weather can divert to Electric Pass (13,485'), the highest pass accessible by trail in Colorado: The trail rises quickly through tall aspen stands to the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness Boundary (.72 miles : 10,425'), where the forest opens across steep, open slopes over Pine Creek. You'll gain 820' in the first mile before moderating on a long open arc with great views up valley (1.5 miles : 11,160'). It crosses a scree field (2.05 miles : 11,555') and scales very steep switchbacks that level to the first split for Electric Pass (2.3 miles : 11,780'). The trail undulates mildly in a thinning forest to an unmarked split for Electric Pass (right), and a sharp turn (left) that drops to a footbridge over the creek (2.58 miles : 11,810'). It continues through treeline across small glades and willow patches to Cathedral Lake (2.8 miles : 11,866'). The east side of Cathedral slopes gently with good social trails around much of the lake (the west side is steep and difficult to reach). Work your way up for aerial views of the lake, and great views down valley. High points around the lake reveal more of Malamute Peak (13,348'), Cathedral Peak (13,943') and a good look at Electric Pass.

3,Electric Pass ,Aspen-Snowmass,9.3,9880,13485,3605,Strenuous,Yes," Electric Pass (13,485') is located 4.65 miles from Cathedral Lake Trailhead in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It's considered the highest named pass accessible by trail in Colorado. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Though ominously named for its exposure to lightning, it's no more susceptible than any other point at this elevation. The route shares the first 2.3 miles with Cathedral Lake, then breaks off on a methodical climb to the rim of a massive cirque that leads precariously on to the pass. The Electric Pass Trail is well conceived with long, sweeping switchbacks on relatively mild terrain. Views are among the best in the Aspen area, rivaled by wildflowers on vast alpine slopes between Cathedral Lake and the pass: The trail rises quickly through tall aspen stands to the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness (.72 miles : 10,425'), where the forest opens across rockslides above the Pine Creek gorge. After gaining 820' in the first mile, travel eases on a long open arc with great views up valley (1.5 miles : 11,160'). It crosses a scree field (2.05 miles : 11,555') to a short section of steep switchbacks to the Electric Pass Trail split (2.3 miles : 11,780'). The trail breaks north into thick willow and clears treeline with Cathedral Lake in sight the rest of the way. Note social trails that branch off down toward the lake on this stretch; keep right at each, and consider them on the return hike for a shortcut to Cathedral Lake. The trail runs up the side of a moraine into meadows at the base of the cirque, where elongated switchbacks begin their way up the NE wall (2.85 miles : 12,160'). Switchbacks shorten up to a saddle that can be mistaken for the pass (4.25 miles : 13,160'). The saddle is a great place to rest and take in views (south) of the route leading to this point, and north over the Devaney Creek drainage, which feeds American Lake. Leahy Peak (13,322') is located east along the saddle, an interesting and non-technical side trip. The trail rises west above the saddle on a tightly wound path that devolves into a faint track across a steep slope with loose and highly unstable scree. Tread carefully on this final run to Electric Pass (4.65 miles : 13,465'), located on a small notch in the cirque wall. Peer NW down Conundrum Creek Valley, and across to Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak, Snowmass Mountain and a line of distinguished red and white peaks in the heart of the Elk Range. Cathedral Peak (13,943') caps the cirque rim and is seemingly just a frisbee toss away, but technical and unreliable terrain separates the pass from it, as well potential routes that would lead down to surrounding drainages. A short scrambling route continues up to Electric Peak (13,635'). Electric Pass (13,485') is located 4.65 miles from Cathedral Lake Trailhead in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness.

4,Conundrum Hot Springs ,Aspen-Snowmass,17.0,8765,11222,2457,Moderate,No," The Conundrum Hot Springs are located 8.5 miles from Conundrum Creek Trailhead off of Castle Creek Road in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. The hot spring complex contains two main pools and four smaller springs that together discharge approximately 130 GPM with a max temperature just over 100 degrees F (each pool varies). Trail Map | Photo Gallery The 8.5 mile distance would usually command a 'difficult' rating, however most consider the trail quite moderate. Strong hikers can easily achieve the roundtrip in a day with an early start. While the springs are the main attraction, the hike in is equally compelling. The Conundrum Creek Trail runs through long stretches of level meadows, aspen forests and valley openings to the springs, with abundant wildlife and open space that's notable for even this expansive wilderness. The springs draw thousands each summer, most who camp in the immediate vicinity. Expect crowds and minimal privacy during peak months, especially weekends and holidays. The springs also serve as a first stop on longer routes to Crested Butte, Copper Basin and East Maroon Pass. See Camping, Rules and Regulations and Worth Noting below for important information on designated sites, fire restrictions, dog restrictions and travel tips: The trail dips and rises across a broad meadow that funnels into conifer and aspen along the creek (1.0 miles : 8,970'). It emerges in a small meadow at 1.75 miles, then the first of several major meadows at 1.85 miles (9,240'). Travel is quick to a bridge leading to the west side of the creek (2.75 miles : 9,390'). The bridge is elevated and narrow - consider crossing in the water if slick or carrying a heavy pack. Mild grades continue across a second large meadow at 3.85 miles (9,550'), past which it steepens on rugged terrain above a deep gorge in the valley (4.5 miles). Note young aspen and fireweed on these steeper slopes, which indicate a recent disturbance that renewed the natural forest cycle. The trail enters a third major meadow at 4.8 miles that stretches (with brief interruption) to a bridge leading east to the Silver Ponds (6.0 miles : 10,240'). Note dogs are not permitted beyond this point. The trail skirts marshy ponds to a marked creek ford back to the west side (6.55 miles : 10,320'). The ford can be voluminous at peak runoff, but is generally safe and easy. The trail opens across a talus field with your first clear view of the upper valley (7.2 miles : 10,455'). It steepens away in a cluttered forest to a sign on the hot springs perimeter (8.15 miles : 10,965'). Camping is only permitted in designated sites beyond this point, and fires are not permitted. There are several campsites just before this sign along the creek where fires are still permitted. The trail hops a creek braid and opens past spurs for designated sites to the split for Triangle Pass. The Conundrum Hot Springs are located across the creek about 100 yards away (8.5 miles : 11,222'). There's one large pool and one small pool in the main area where most people congregate. Clothing is optional, and expect a lively crowd. The springs are at treeline in a valley topped by Cathedral Peak (13,943'), Conundrum Peak (14,022') and Castle Peak (14,265'), which share a similar geologic make-up and appearance to Maroon Bells.

5,Triangle Pass ,Aspen-Snowmass,21.0,8765,12919,4154,Strenuous,No,"  Triangle Pass is located 10.5 miles from Conundrum Creek Trailhead in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It spans a small notch in the west valley wall above Conundrum Hot Springs, with terrific views and continuing passage to Crested Butte (Gothic), Copper Basin and East Maroon Pass.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	While the Conundrum Creek Trail is among the most heavily traveled in Aspen, few continue two miles beyond the hot springs to the pass, which is removed from more popular backpacking routes such as the 4-Pass Loop and West Maroon Creek Trail to Crested Butte.

The springs are just 100 yards away over the creek, and the main trail continues right past the last designated sites and clears treeline. 	Here the valley truly opens with expanding views across the entire drainage. Grades steepen through willow mats that give way to rolling meadows. Scan this vast area for elk and goats as you go. 	The trail climbs in short steep spurts with several deliberate bends toward the west valley wall (9.5 miles : 12,045'). There's a saddle on the valley headwall (due south) that appears to be your destination, but in fact that's Coffee Pot Pass. 	The trail edges closer to the west wall before turning sharply up switchbacks across loose scree and till to Triangle Pass (10.5 miles : 12,919'). The pass is an unassuming col high on the valley wall, with panoramic views across Conundrum Valley. Maroon Bells and a line of peaks in the Elk Range can be seen to the north and west, where the trail tilts down a winding path to Copper Basin and on to Gothic north of Crested Butte.

Mild grades continue across a second large meadow at 3.85 miles (9,550'), past which it steepens on rugged terrain above a deep gorge in the valley (4.5 miles).	The trail enters a third major meadow at 4.8 miles that stretches to a bridge leading east to the Silver Ponds (6.0 miles : 10,240'). Note dogs are not permitted beyond this point.	The trail skirts marshy ponds to a marked creek ford back to the west side (6.55 miles : 10,320'). The ford can be voluminous at peak runoff, but is generally safe and easy. The trail opens across a talus field with your first clear view of the upper valley (7.2 miles : 10,455').	It steepens away in a cluttered forest to a sign on the hot springs perimeter (8.15 miles : 10,965'). Camping is only permitted in designated sites beyond this point, and fires are not permitted. There are several campsites just before this sign along the creek where fires are still permitted.	The trail hops a creek braid and opens past designated sites to the split for Conundrum Hot Springs and Triangle Pass (8.48 miles : 11,195'). The springs are just 100 yards away over the creek, and the main trail continues right past the last designated sites and clears treeline.	Here the valley truly opens with expanding views across the entire drainage. Grades steepen through willow mats that give way to rolling meadows. Scan this vast area for elk and goats as you go.	The trail climbs in short steep spurts with several deliberate bends toward the west valley wall (9.5 miles : 12,045'). There's a saddle on the valley headwall (due south) that appears to be your destination, but in fact that's Coffee Pot Pass.	The trail edges closer to the west wall before turning sharply up switchbacks across loose scree and till to Triangle Pass (10.5 miles : 12,919'). The pass is an unassuming col high on the valley wall, with panoramic views across Conundrum Valley. Maroon Bells and a line of peaks in the Elk Range can be seen to the north and west, where the trail tilts down a winding path to Copper Basin and on to Gothic north of Crested Butte.",39.119133333333,-106.8561,217.88333333333333
6,Difficult Creek Trail ,Aspen-Snowmass,6.0,8145,9517,1363,Moderate,Yes," The Difficult Creek Trail runs 3 miles above and along Difficult Creek in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. This moderately strenuous trail begins at Difficult Creek Campground just outside Aspen, crosses the Roaring Fork River and joins Difficult Creek through diverse montane forests. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail is maintained for 3 miles with unmaintained segments that intuitively follow the creek deep into the backcountry. The maintained portion is subjectively unspectacular, but provides a good workout with the opportunity to explore a lightly traveled drainage in the Collegiate Peaks: The trail begins on a level path through diverse scrub and aspen to a long bridge over the Roaring Fork River (.18 miles) and Collegiate Peaks Wilderness Boundary, where it briefly meets Difficult Creek (.48 miles : 8,230'). It follows it for a short time before rising away in a predominantly coniferous forest touched by beetlekill and deadfall (1.0 miles : 8,525'). Grades steepen to a small stream crossing (1.7 miles : 8,970'), past which the trail bends west across a rocky hillside with partial views of peaks over Independence Pass (2.0 miles : 9,170'). It meets back up with Difficult Creek (2.5 miles : 9,375') and turns south beside it with many easy access points. The trail gradually levels in a mixed forest just east of the creek and to an unmarked point where maintenance officially ends (3.0 miles : 9,517'). The Forest Service suggests there are old cabin remains in the area, though none were observed on this report. The trail gradually fades past this anticlimactic point, but travel intuitively follows the creek with nominal elevation gain into wide, level sections up the valley. Nicely spaced trees provide good viewing lanes for wildlife with manageable clutter for off-trail exploration.

7,Copper Lake Loop ,Aspen-Snowmass,23.35,8755,8765,4164,Moderate-Strenuous,No," Copper Lake (11,321') is located 10.65 miles from East Maroon Creek Trailhead on the Crested Butte side of East Maroon Pass (11,824'). This small but shapely lake sits at treeline .95 miles and 503' below the pass, and 4.8 miles from the Copper Trailhead in Gothic where thru-hikers can arrange pick up. Trail Map | Photo Gallery   Those looking for a more interesting return from Copper Lake to Aspen can follow a connector trail to Triangle Pass (12,911') and drop down Conundrum Creek to form a 2-car shuttle loop (it's a relatively short drive between trailheads). This longer and more challenging route features a stunning traverse across the Copper Valley headwall and a stop at Conundrum Hot Springs on the 10.5 mile descent from Triangle Pass. Camping is only permitted in 8 designated campsites at Copper Lake (6 + 2 for stock). Fires are not permitted at these sites and within 1/4 mile of the lake. See below for more information on camping, fees, permits, bear canisters and trailhead directions and access:  The trail begins on level intervals of meadow and aspen to a connector for Maroon Lake (1.3 miles : 9,070'). Here it bends SW into the East Maroon Creek drainage with views of Pyramid Peak (14,018'). Travel is quick on mild grades past a riparian restoration area (2.7 miles : 9470') to an unmarked spur for a horse camp (4.2 miles : 9,725').  Traces of an old road are periodically evident past cabin remains (4.9 miles) to the first of two creek fords (5.6 miles : 9,880'), which can be swift at peak runoff. Once over it rises sharply to an avalanche-cleared slope and the second ford back to the east side (6.45 miles : 10,235'). It climbs steeply to a long, arcing talus slope (7.0 miles : 10,605') and steadies on sections of the old road. Stay vigilant, as the trail veers right at a potentially unmarked point (7.7 miles : 10,935').  Though maps indicate a clear split, it's very easy to miss. Staying left keeps you on a clear path that fades above treeline on the east side of the valley heading toward Copper Pass - east Maroon Pass is located on the NW side of the valley.  Timber thins as you turn NW across the top of East Maroon Creek (8.5 miles) to a large basin under the pass (8.8 miles). The trail curls up the west valley wall on a ramp-like path to East Maroon Pass (9.7 miles : 11,824'). It drops from the pass and makes a sharp hairpin turn with your first look at Copper Lake, then takes a long arcing descent into the basin. The trail drops to a 3-way split for Triangle Pass, the lake and campsite access (10.55 miles : 11,405'). Take the unmarked spur down to Copper Lake (10.65 miles : 11,321'). Distances noted here omit the .2 mile roundtrip spur to Copper Lake: To continue on the loop, follow signs for Triangle Pass which lead up and undulate to the Copper Creek Trail split (10.9 miles : 11,420'). The trail bends east and steepens across the talus-strewn headwall with long views down Copper Creek valley. At 11.95 miles the trail curls across the headwall's highest, steepest slopes toward Triangle. You'll encounter a few narrow sections that may be unsafe to cross with snow cover. Travel gradually moderates across broad slopes up to Triangle Pass (12.85 miles : 12,911'). The trail drops from Triangle Pass into the Conundrum Creek drainage on a steep, winding path that moderates across attractive alpine meadows to a spur for Conundrum Hot Springs (14.85 miles : 11,190'). The springs are a quick detour across the creek. The main trail continues back through treeline on a steady descent in varied terrain to a wide creek crossing, which can be swift at peak runoff (16.8 miles : 10,320'). Find the shallowest way across and resume variously rugged travel down to a long bridge back over the creek at Silver Pond (17.35 miles : 10,240'). Once across travel gradually moderates in the mid-lower valley across expansive meadows separated by aspen groves and mixed timber to the Conundrum Creek Trailhead to complete the loop (23.35 miles : 8,765'). Copper Lake (11,321') is located 10.65 miles from East Maroon Creek Trailhead on the Crested Butte side of East Maroon Pass (11,824').

8,East Maroon Pass ,Aspen-Snowmass,19.4,8755,11824,3069,Moderate,Yes," East Maroon Pass is located 9.7 miles from East Maroon Portal in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. This long but moderate trail follows East Maroon Creek to its origin just below the pass, and continues down the west side into Copper Basin and on to Gothic near Crested Butte.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery East Maroon Pass is arguably the easiest thru-hike route to Crested Butte, though it lacks the high alpine charisma of West Maroon Pass (12,465'). Much of the trail follows an old wagon route chosen for milder grades and lower elevations. Accordingly East Maroon sees heavier horse traffic than any other stemming from Maroon Bells. It also joins Triangle Pass (via Copper Basin) and the Conundrum Creek valley to form a compelling backpacking loop. This is a great option if seeking solitude apart from the busy 4 Pass Loop network. Highlights include long stretches of open valley, great views of Pyramid Peak and some of the finest aspen groves and autumn colors in the area: The trail begins on level intervals of meadow and aspen to a connector for Maroon Lake (1.3 miles : 9,070'). Here it bends SW into the East Maroon Creek drainage with views of Pyramid Peak (14,018'). Travel is quick on level grades before rising above a riparian restoration area (2.7 miles : 9470'). Look for moose in beaver-dammed oxbows below. It drops back on a fast pace to an unmarked spur for a horse camp at 4.2 miles (9,725'). Traces of the old road are periodically evident past cabin remains (4.9 miles) to the first of two major creek fords (5.6 miles : 9,880'). Volume can be swift across each at peak runoff - anticipate knee high+ water. Once through it rises sharply into a coniferous forest that breaks across an avalanche-cleared slope to the second ford back to the east side (6.45 miles : 10,235'). It climbs steeply to a long, open arc across a talus slope (7.0 miles : 10,605'). Find raspberries tucked in the rocks, and good views of Pyramid Peak and adjacent ridges that form the west valley wall. The trail continues steadily in a pleasant but nondescript subalpine forest on sections of the old road. Stay vigilant, as the trail braids in several places and makes a key right turn at a potentially unmarked point (7.7 miles : 10,935').  Though maps indicate a clear split, it's very easy to miss. Veering left keeps you on a clear path that fades above treeline on the east side of the valley, heading toward Copper Pass.  Keep right at all braids and forks that lead NW across the valley. Timber thins as you turn NW and cross the top of East Maroon Creek (8.5 miles) to a large basin under the pass (8.8 miles). There's some great camping terrain in this area. The trail curls up the west valley wall on a ramp-like path to East Maroon Pass (9.7 miles : 11,824'). Continue down the far side for views of Copper Lake, or take a social trail to more central points in the valley with excellent views down the entire drainage. Elk and mountain goat are active in this rich and lightly traveled part of the valley. East Maroon Pass is located 9.7 miles from East Maroon Portal in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness.

9,East Snowmass Trail ,Aspen-Snowmass,14.1,8422,12684,4262,Strenuous,Yes," East Snowmass Trail runs 7.05 miles south from the backside of Snowmass Ski Area to a 12,684' pass separating the East Snowmass Creek drainage and Willow Lake basin. It continues approximately 1 mile and 680' down to the Willow Lake Trail, which rolls .7 miles across open alpine meadows to the lake (11,795'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery The East Snowmass Trail is a lightly used route into the heart of the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness, an ideal choice for strong hikers looking to avoid crowds that emanate from Maroon Lake (there's also no fee). The trail is distinguished by nearly 5 miles of open valley travel framed by colorful red walls leading up to the pass. It can be linked with the Willow Lake and Maroon-Snowmass trails to form a loop that scales Willow Pass and Buckskin Pass before dropping to Snowmass Lake and the Maroon-Snowmass Trailhead, just a few steps up the road from where you started. Whether tackling it as a day hike or part of a longer backpacking route, get an early start to avoid summer storms on this exposed and challenging trail: The East Snowmass Trail climbs steeply through aspen and mixed pine to the Wilderness Boundary (.65 miles) and Ditch Trail split (1.12 miles : 9,105'). It keeps a similar pace through diverse forests before emerging in open space (2.2 miles : 9,755') and moderating across rolling meadows in the lower valley. It rises steadily with several short, steep intervals across open slopes to consecutive stream crossings at 3.45 miles (10,555'), the second of which is veiled by heavy brush. Once through it enters a tall spruce-fir forest and eases for half a mile before another steep push leads to flat, stream cut meadows on the valley floor (4.3 miles : 11,040'). This is arguably the finest stretch to camp on the East Snowmass Trail no matter your final destination. The trail steepens past the meadows through the last bands of timber to treeline (5.1 miles : 11,455'). Travel now moderates across an expansive alpine landscape that rises incrementally to the pass. At 6.0 miles (12,015') it bends SE and dips past an unmarked fork (keep left) and crosses a stream to the east side of the valley (6.35 miles : 12,065'). Once over it rises steeply up the east valley wall to East Snowmass Pass (7.05 miles : 12,684'). The pass spans a small notch on the valley headwall with exceptional views across the Willow Lake basin and a line of peaks across the Elk Range. It continues south on a very steep descent to the Willow Lake Trail split, which is .7 miles from the lake and .8 miles from Willow Pass (12,572'). East Snowmass Trail runs 7.05 miles south from the backside of Snowmass Ski Area to a 12,684' pass separating the East Snowmass Creek drainage and Willow Lake basin.

10,Fryingpan Lakes ,Aspen-Snowmass,9.1,10012,11032,1020,Moderate,Yes," The Fryingpan Lakes are located 4.55 miles from Road #505 (5.7 miles south of Fryingpan Road) in the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness. The two main lakes are separated by a wide isthmus, and a third lake .7 miles below offers a comparable aestehtic with more accommodating space for camping. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Fryingpan Lakes form the headwaters of the Fryingpan River, a major tributary of the Roaring Fork celebrated for its 14 miles of Gold Medal Waters on the tail of Ruedi Reservoir. While thousands visit the Fryingpan each summer to fish and recreate on Ruedi Reservoir, few venture up to this free-flowing headwater just west of the Continental Divide. Mild-moderate grades follow the river through subalpine forests, open valleys and wide meadows to the lakes. This lightly used but well-maintained trail is ideal for backpackers, families and trail runners, and features good wildlife viewing and abundant flowers across long open slopes. An unmaintained route continues over the Divide below Deer Mountain (13,761') into the Lake Creek drainage near Independence Pass: The trail begins near the Marten Creek - Fryingpan confluence and rises quickly into a moss-draped forest. It reaches the H-F Wilderness Boundary (.4 miles : 10,085') and crosses a big open slope at .92 miles (10,280'), the first of several high clearings leading to a wide bridge over the Fryingpan River (2.35 miles : 10,602'). The trail continues south up the east side of the river with expanding views across the valley. It crosses the base of a rockslide (2.85 miles : 10,742') and resumes moderate travel into a big, level meadow (3.45 miles) leading to the first lake (3.75 miles : 10,933'). The lake is small but lies in a wide, flat section of the valley with ideal camping terrain and views of Mount Oklahoma (13,845'). The trail undulates around the rugged east shore to gentle terrain along the inlet where campers will find more privacy during peak summer months (4.0 miles). It re-enters the timber and negotiates a shifting, rugged path through large boulders to the first Fryingpan Lake (4.4 miles : 11,024'). The trail picks through more of the same to a large isthmus separating the upper and lower lakes (4.52 miles : 11,032'). The isthmus is wide and slightly elevated, offering great views of both lakes and the upper valley. Tall knolls around the lakes provide good vantages but require a little scrambling to reach. A short stream bisects the isthmus and connects the two lakes. The main trail continues into a meadow-like inlet area and follows an unmaintained route up to the Divide.

11,Granite Lakes ,Aspen-Snowmass,13.4,8815,11568,2753,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," The Granite Lakes are located 5.95 and 6.7 miles from Mt Nast Colony Road in the Hunter - Fryingpan Wilderness. The lower lake (11,319') sits just below treeline against the west valley wall, and the upper lake (11,568') is .75 miles ahead in a more open setting at treeline. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Both lakes are relatively small but with enough space to camp and fish abundant trout stock.  The trail begins in Nast (31 miles east of Basalt) and follows the Fryingpan River 3.4 miles before turning up Granite Creek and climbing 2100' in just 3.3 miles to the lakes. It sees light use with short sections along Granite Creek that may require route finding. Visitors will enjoy miles of river access, healthy forests and solitude on the hike to Granite Lakes: Walk from the designated parking lot and bear left onto Mt Nast Colony Road to find the trailhead on the left. The trail begins on a level path between private homes and the river. It runs fast to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary (.98 miles : 9.045') and undulates along the river in a heavy forest. Stay alert across vague and shifting sections.  The trail reaches a sparingly marked fork where social trails continue along the river and the main trail splits right into the Granite Creek drainage (3.4 miles : 9,490'). It steepens considerably to meet Granite Creek at an outcrop over a small waterfall (3.75 miles : 9,835') and keeps a challenging pace beside scenic (albeit hard to reach) cascades.  The trail abruptly fades in a cluttered forest where cut logs indicate a designated route but little else (4.35 miles : 10,330'). Options are limited, but the intended route crosses the creek (left) at 4.55 miles, follows a short rugged stretch along the water and crosses back (right) over a small stream at 4.7 miles into a big meadow.  Cairns lead up the right side to another stream crossing (4.83 miles : 10,575') past which travel clarifies on a steep push up the valley wall to Lower Granite Lake (5.95 miles : 11,319'). The lake is embedded in the west valley wall with open grass and level timber on the east side. There are a few particularly good campsites at the lake. The main trail moderates in a high and thinning forest to Upper Granite Lake (6.7 miles : 11,568'). This final segment can be vague (especially with snow cover) but is generally easy to follow. The upper lake is small with open grass around much of it that creates a spacious feel. The Granite Lakes are located 5.95 and 6.7 miles from Mt Nast Colony Road in the Hunter - Fryingpan Wilderness.

12,Hay Park Trail ,Aspen-Snowmass,14.9,8482,9370,888,Moderate,Yes," The Hay Park Trail runs 7.45 miles from Capitol Creek Road west of Old Snowmass to the Thomas Lakes Trail above Carbondale. This long but moderate trail passes through aspen-covered slopes cut by several creeks and high meadows with great views from Capitol Peak to Mount Sopris. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Hay Park includes 9980 acres of valuable mid-elevation habitat that's part of the Hay Park Wilderness Addition Proposal to the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness Area, an initiative that envisages a road-less 200,000+ acre block in the Roaring Fork Valley. The Hay Park Trail is ideal for running, biking and equestrians, with miles of contiguous aspen that make it a great autumn choice. This corridor supports abundant wildlife and is open to hunting (public lands only). Be mindful of hunting seasons and wear bright colors during these periods. There are several unmarked splits off the Hay Park Trail that can easily be confused for the main trail. Carry a good map and have a general understanding of your route before heading out. Respect private property lines and remain on designated trails. Note that distance and elevation gain figures will vary between sources depending on which trailhead you start at - Hay Park or Thomas Lakes - and where the source determines the trail to officially begin and end. The following description begins at Hay Park Trailhead on Capitol Creek Road and runs north to its merge point with the Thomas Lakes Trail: From the Hay Park BLM Lot, cross a pasture to the Backcountry Board (.23 miles) and begin a steep climb through dense aspen. Pass through a gate (.7 miles) and cross a road to regain the trail. It drops to another road at .88 miles (9,020'); turn left and split off the road (left) at 1.1 miles. It narrows back on singletrack, dips across a small stream and rises through tightly-lined aspen (1.5 miles : 9,140'). Enjoy a brief opening at 1.75 miles to a fork that splits right (1.9 miles : 9,245'). You'll exit the Capitol Creek Land Co Private Property Boundary at 2.0 miles and hop consecutive creeks at 2.2 miles (9,175'). Travel is fast and nondescript through greater concentrations of fir to East Sopris Creek (2.8 miles : 9,205'), past which mature aspen take over with good viewing lanes. The trail undulates to a subtle fork at 3.35 miles; keep right and curl steeply down into a shallow gulch and cross another stream (3.38 miles : 9,185'). It rises out and moderates across high clearings in a park-like setting with terrific mountain views (3.65 - 4.15 miles : 9,345'). The trail drops to a small pond and fork with no signage (4.25 miles : 9,305') - the following description continues up the left fork on the far, upper slope of the pond: The left fork steepens out of the forest and passes through a fence into big open space (4.8 miles : 9,645'). Travel moderates across high, expansive meadows to a second fence at the trail's highest point (5.2 miles : 9,710'). This is a great place to see elk with panoramas that include Capitol Peak and Mount Sopris. It's also a sensible turnaround point, as travel is more business-like to the terminus. The trail dips into a stream-crossed meadow and funnels onto a service road that drops sharply to West Sorpis Creek (6.25 miles : 9,540'). It crosses and moderates in mixed timber that breaks across open slopes to the Thomas Lakes Trail split (7.45 miles : 9,370').

13,Williams Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,3.8,10010,10815,805,Moderate,Yes," Williams Lake is located 1.9 miles from Hell Roaring Trailhead on Capitol Creek Road in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. It lies in a heavily wooded basin off the Hell Roaring Trail, which continues west across the Elk Mountains to the Avalanche - Silver Creek Trail outside Carbondale. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Williams Lake famously inspired John Denver's 'Rocky Mountain High' while he was camping at the lake to view the Perseid Meteor Showers which happen every August. Though Williams Lake lacks the alpine luster of others in the area, it's a great choice for families, anglers, short-distance camping and simply escaping the crowds. Hardscrabble Lake is just .1 mile off the main trail with notably good fishing. The Hell Roaring Trailhead is located 10.7 miles west of Highway 82 on Capitol Creek Road. Only capable 4WD cars with experienced drivers should attempt to reach this trailhead by car. You may otherwise park at Hay Park (7.8 miles from HWY 82) or Capitol Creek Trailhead (9.5 miles from HWY 82) and walk the road. Good high clearance is necessary beyond Hay Park. These park-and-walk options add 5.8 and 2.4 miles to the roundtrip hike, respectively. Always call ahead for driving conditions, as this road is subject to washout and deadfall: The trail rises steadily in a heavy spruce-fir forest to the Hardscrabble Lake Trail split (.28 miles : 10,140'). Hardscrabble is more of a pond than lake, but has excellent fish stock. The trail continues on short, steep intervals to the Williams Lake Trail split (1.05 miles : 10,460'), which splits north and drops across two bridges spanning a marshy corridor (1.12 miles : 10,405'). It gradually bends NW beside the lake's outlet stream up to Williams Lake (1.9 miles : 10,815').

14,Hunter Valley Trail ,Aspen-Snowmass,8.9,7905,8972,1067,Moderate,Yes," 	The Hunter Creek Trail joins the Hunter Valley Trail to form an 8.9 mile out-and-back route east of downtown Aspen. The hike features scenic bridges over Hunter Creek and expansive, aspen-ringed meadows with alpine backdrops in the Maroon Bells and Hunter-Frying Pan wilderness areas.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  The Hunter Creek Trail climbs steeply along the creek to a big meadow at 10th Mountain Bridge, where the Hunter Valley Trail continues east up the north side of Hunter Creek until fading out shortly past the last cabin remains. 	The Hunter Creek trail system sees heavy use, especially on summer weekends. Honor yield protocols and posted leash laws. 	There are several access points and potential routes for reaching Hunter Valley Trail - the following description begins on Lone Pine Road in downtown Aspen: 	From Lone Pine Road, follow signs behind the residential area to boardwalks along the creek and consecutive bridge crossings (.3 and .47 miles). Note diverse vegetation in this riparian corridor, including large cottonwoods ain the creek channel. 	Grades steepen past the Lani White Trail split (.5 miles : 8,050') to a 3rd bridge (.65 miles) and Benedict Bridge - Red Mountain BLM Trailhead spur (.95 miles : 8,370'). 	Cross Benedict Bridge back to the south side, where steep travel continues past the Verena Mallory Trail split (1.15 miles : 8,525') and over a service road (1.4 miles) to a Backcountry Board + Map on the edge of a large meadow (1.6 miles : 8,655'). 	The valley opens and levels past the Hunter Creek Cutoff Trail (1.7 miles : 8,665') to the 10th Mountain Bridge and first sign for the Hunter Valley Trail (1.85 miles : 8,695'). 	Here you may cross the bridge or continue straight to another at 2.6 miles (8,790') - both lead to the north side of Hunter Creek and continue on as the Hunter Valley Trail. The routes are virtually equidistant; the following description keeps straight to the 2.6 mile bridge. 	The 2.6 mile bridge crosses Hunter Creek and a series of scenic pools ideal for fishing.

15,Deadman Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,13.6,11506,10965,541,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," Deadman Lake is located 6.8 miles from Independence Lake Trailhead in the Hunter-Frying Pan Wilderness. It lies in a wide, level meadow along the South Fork Frying Pan River. While the lake aesthetic is nondescript, the hike in is exceptional. Trail Map | Photo Gallery There are two ways to reach Deadman Lake from the Lost Man Loop Trail off of Highway 82 (east of Aspen, CO). Arguably the most scenic begins at Independence Lake Trailhead and scales Lost Man Pass to Lost Man Lake, and on to the South Fork Pass Trail. The South Fork Pass Trail leaves the busy Lost Man Loop and drops into the South Fork drainage, a lightly visited area that supports high concentrations of wildlife. Visitors will enjoy two alpine passes, three lakes, three valleys and great camping on the hike to Deadman Lake: The trail begins at treeline up to the Hunter-Frying Pan Wilderness Boundary and split for Linkins Lake (.15 miles : 11,615'). It crosses the Roaring Fork (.48 miles : 11,735') and keeps a steady pace between Twinning Peak (east) and Geissler Mountain (west) up to Independence Lake (1.8 miles: 12,487'). Independence Lake fills a shallow bench under Lost Man Pass, with a large tarn .1 mile away that's easy to reach and worth exploring. The trail follows the level shore before turning sharply up to Lost Man Pass (2.35 miles : 12,810'). Lost Man Pass spans a divisive ridge between the Roaring Fork headwaters (south), and the Lost Man Creek drainage (north). Views of the Collegiate Peaks are outstanding from the pass. The trail tilts down steep switchbacks across short sections of talus to Lost Man Lake (2.75 miles : 12,482'). Anticipate snow patches through mid-summer on this north-facing slope. The trail continues around the lake and arcs NE down valley in a high-alpine landscape. It drops steadily to a swale-like meadow (4.25 miles : 11,680'), and undulates ruggedly above to the South Fork Pass Trail split (4.95 miles : 11,635'). Expect sections of faint, shifting trail that can be hard to follow with lingering snow or after washouts from here to the lake. The South Fork Pass Trail breaks NE on a mild climb to South Fork Pass (5.25 miles : 11,725'), which is fairly subtle and perhaps only obvious once you begin a steep descent into the valley below. Travel moderates in the narrow upper valley back to treeline and the top of Deadman Gulch (6.25 miles : 11,305'). Here it drops 270' in just .3 miles to an abrupt opening in the central valley, and spills into a vast meadow cut by the South Fork (6.55 miles : 11,015'). Take note of this transition point, as the trail between forest and meadow can be hard to find on the return. The trail all but fades in this damp open space, with faint tracks marked sparingly by cairns on the far west side down to Deadman Lake (6.8 miles : 10,965'). Deadman Lake is more of a glorified marshy pond, but the meadows around it are a virtual playground, and major thoroughfare for wildlife. The trail continues about 3.5 miles to its northern terminus.

These stunning high-alpine lakes are separated by Lost Man Pass (12,810'), which offers simultaneous views of the lakes and a line of summits in the Collegiate Peaks. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Both lakes are located on the 8.9 mile Lost Man Loop Trail, which can be accessed from two points on Highway 82: The Lost Man Campground or Independence Lake Trailhead. Note the Lost Man Loop is not a true loop - it begins/ends at these trailheads, which are 4 miles apart. To complete the loop you'll either need to arrange a shuttle or walk the road. Both starting points have merit - the following description begins at Independence Lake Trailhead for the most direct route: The trail begins at treeline up to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary and split for Linkins Lake, a short and worthwhile side trip (.15 miles : 11,615'). It crosses the Roaring Fork (.48 miles : 11,735') and keeps a steady pace up the east side between Twinning Peak (east) and Geissler Mountain (west). The trail gradually bends NE to the open shore of Independence Lake (1.8 miles: 12,487'). Independence Lake fills a broad alpine bench under Lost Man Pass with a large tarn .1 mile away that's easy to reach and worth exploring. The trail follows the level shore before turning sharply up to Lost Man Pass (2.35 miles : 12,810'). Lost Man Pass spans a divisive ridge between the Roaring Fork headwaters (south), and Lost Man Creek drainage (north). Views are outstanding, with hike-able routes that branch off to Geissler Mountain and points on the Continental Divide. The trail tilts steeply down switchbacks that cross short sections of talus to Lost Man Lake (2.75 miles : 12,482'). Anticipate lingering snow through mid-summer on this north-facing slope. Lost Man Lake is larger than Independence, but only it's east side is open. The trail continues by the lake into high alpine meadows in the upper valley, and to its west terminus at Lost Man Campground. Views down Lost Man Creek valley are worth a look, and a great place to scan high slopes and ridges for mountain goats, bighorn sheep and elk.

The trail gradually bends NE to the open shore of Independence Lake (1.8 miles: 12,487').Independence Lake fills a broad alpine bench under Lost Man Pass with a large tarn .1 mile away that's easy to reach and worth exploring. The trail follows the level shore before turning sharply up to Lost Man Pass (2.35 miles : 12,810').Lost Man Pass spans a divisive ridge between the Roaring Fork headwaters (south), and Lost Man Creek drainage (north). Views are outstanding, with hike-able routes that branch off to Geissler Mountain and points on the Continental Divide.The trail tilts steeply down switchbacks that cross short sections of talus to Lost Man Lake (2.75 miles : 12,482'). Anticipate lingering snow through mid-summer on this north-facing slope.Lost Man Lake is larger than Independence, but only it's east side is open. The trail continues by the lake into high alpine meadows in the upper valley, and to its west terminus at Lost Man Campground. Views down Lost Man Creek valley are worth a look, and a great place to scan high slopes and ridges for mountain goats, bighorn sheep and elk.",39.124733333333,-106.581816666667,157.95
17,Linkins Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,1.2,11506,12008,502,Easy-Moderate,Yes," Linkins Lake (12,008') is located .6 miles from Independence Lake Trailhead off Highway 82 in the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness. It fills a steep-walled bowl along the south ridge of Geissler Mountain. This short, family-friendly hike offers a high alpine lake experience with minimal effort. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail begins at treeline up to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary and split for Linkins Lake (.15 miles : 11,615'). The Linkins Lake Trail breaks left and winds steeply up the west valley wall to the east side of Linkins Lake (.6 miles : 12,008').  The lake is fairly large with a gentle open shore ideal for fishing and exploration. Social trails lead over the lake to outcrops with great aerial views of the basin, and to scrambling routes that continue up the Geissler ridge. It's also quite easy to explore high alpine meadows over the north shore. Consider continuing on to Independence Lake (12,487'), a moderate 1.65 miles from the split to Linkins Lake along the Lost Man Loop.

18,La Plata Peak ,Aspen-Snowmass,8.6,10170,14361,4191,Strenuous,Yes," La Plata Peak (14,361') is located 4.3 miles from La Plata Peak Trailhead off Highway 82 in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. It's the 5th highest peak in Colorado, distinguished by a broad west flank, bulky-rock summit and exceptional views that extend deep into the Collegiate Peaks and from Twin Lakes to Independence Pass. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The hike begins across a deep gorge in South Fork Lake Creek and joins La Plata Creek, which it follows into the upper valley before splitting up La Plata's west flank on a strenuous push to the north ridge. It continues on a variously steep and rugged path across sections of sharp talus to the summit. The main route is non-technical, reasonably well-marked and minimally exposed, though you may find the descent equally time consuming while negotiating loose rock on steep grades. La Plata Peak Trailhead is located on Highway 82, 14 miles west of the Highway 82 - Highway 24 junction in Twin Lakes (28.1 miles east of Original Street in downtown Aspen). The trail officially begins .3 miles down South Fork Lake Creek Road (FDR 391), which is private. You must walk the road to access the trail (left side of road). Distances here begin from the main trail access point on South Fork Lake Creek Road: The trail begins on private land and quickly meets a bridge over a scenic gorge in the South Fork. Cross and bear right into an undulating aspen forest to a makeshift log bridge (.55 miles) that leads to mud reinforced steps at the base of La Plata Gulch (.8 miles : 10,355'). The steps funnel into La Plata Gulch and beside steep cascades on La Plata Creek. The trail climbs 655' in just .7 miles into the wide, U-shaped upper valley (1.5 miles : 11,010'). It levels briefly before edging (left) up the west flank of La Plata on very steep, tightly wound switchbacks that gradually lengthen and straighten through 12,000' (2.4 miles). Travel moderates across grassy benches before another steep push to the north ridge with great views (east) down La Plata Basin (3.0 miles : 12,750'). The trail climbs steadily to the base of a large talus slope where you'll find several cairn-marked routes but no great options (3.5 miles : 13,468'). Pick your way through steep, uneven rock until finding a decent track through 14,000' (3.95 miles). The trail continues on a rugged but straight-forward path to a false summit (4.25 miles) and across a rocky ridge to La Plata Peak (14,361'). You may continue on a Class 3 scramble along Ellingwood Ridge, or improvise your return down La Plata Basin to join Lake Creek and follow well-defined social trails back to the trailhead to make a loop. La Plata Peak (14,361') is located 4.3 miles from La Plata Peak Trailhead off Highway 82 in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness.

19,Grizzly Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,7.3,10610,12523,1913,Moderate,Yes," Grizzly Lake (12,523') is located 3.65 miles from Lincoln Creek Road in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. It fills a steep-walled cirque carved from the base of Grizzly Peak (13,988') just west of the Continental Divide. Trail Map | Photo Gallery This relatively moderate hike follows long stretches of alpine meadow beside Grizzly Creek until veering away across high alpine terraces on the final ascent. The lake is hemmed by tight cirque walls but tall knolls on the open side have nice vantages over the lake and valley. Fishing is also quite good at Grizzly Lake, which sees lighter traffic than others near Aspen due to the difficult drive up Lincoln Creek Road: The trail climbs 365' in just .45 miles to an expansive meadow where travel moderates for the next 1.7 miles across big, open slopes over Grizzly Creek. This fast stretch features great views across the valley, ideal camping terrain and wildflowers that rival any during their mid July - August peak. It arcs SE down to the creek, crosses to the west side (2.15 miles : 11,435') and steepens toward the west valley wall. The trail edges away from the creek before turning sharply west and leveling across an alpine terrace from 3.0 - 3.35 miles (12,080 ' - 12,290').  This abrupt deviation from the creek may seem counter-intuitive and hard to read with snow cover. Carry a good map and be patient with route finding past the 2.15 creek crossing. Look for elk and goat in high alpine meadows and craggy walls on this attractive segment. The trail heads straight across to a switchback notched in the west valley wall (3.35 miles : 12,290'), which turns south on a steep run to Grizzly Lake (3.65 miles : 12,523'). Level ground is limited on the shore, but tall knolls with clear social trails are easy to scale with great views across the basin, valley and meadows you pass from 3.0 - 3.35 miles.

20,New York Creek Trail ,Aspen-Snowmass,8.2,10095,12273,2178,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," New York Creek Trail runs 4.1 miles from Lincoln Creek Road to the Continental Divide in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. It continues over a 12,273' pass to the Goodwin-Greene Hut (west), Bowman Creek Trail (south) and Ptarmigan Lake (southeast). Trail Map | Photo Gallery This lightly used trail follows New York Creek through attractive forests and meadows into a large alpine basin below Difficult Peak (12,925') and winds steeply up to the Continental Divide. Views are exceptional, and you'll likely see more elk than people in these big open spaces. Anticipate vague sections, especially above treeline and over the pass. Cairns mark the final push to the Pass, which can be confused for well-worn game tracks following similar routes: The trail begins on a flat bank along Lincoln Creek, which you'll immediately cross. This ford is wide and can be difficult during peak runoff. Once over there's another small channel of stagnant water that also must be crossed to regain the trail, hidden by dense willow just beyond the water. Punch through the willow and find a clear trail (.15 miles) that crosses a small meadow and rises steadily on an old roadbed. Keep straight at a large cairn (.6 miles : 10,355') and emerge in a meadow where the trail arcs steeply up to the aqueduct service road (.95 miles : 10,580'). Turn right on the road and follow it past an S-curve over Brooklyn Gulch (1.3 miles) to a sign pointing left off the road back onto the trail (1.45 miles : 10,605'). It enters a verdant, moss-draped forest and crosses the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness Boundary at 1.55 miles (10,645'). The trail rises steadily in dark timber above New York Creek to a crossing at 2.25 miles (10,830'), then cuts across large meadows to the west side of the valley. Travel steepens across open slopes with good views across stream-cut meadows below. It gradually bends away into a high subalpine forest and crosses left over a stream (3.22 miles : 11,475'). There are many good places to camp in this idyllic stretch of forest. The trail clears treeline (3.5 miles : 11,710') into a vast alpine basin framed by the Divide and Difficult Peak (12,925'). The trail can be faint and cairns may be hard to pick out - a map is helpful to stay on track and avoid well-defined animal tracks that use similar routes to reach the Divide. The trail generally angels SE through rolling tundra on the final push to the Pass on the Continental Divide (4.1 miles : 12,273'). Views extend down New York Creek, south down Bowman Creek, deep into the Collegiates and across much of the Elk Mountains. Improvised travel is fairly easy on the Divide, but consider your route carefully across delicate tundra vegetation.

21,Tabor Pass ,Aspen-Snowmass,7.9,10285,12462,2177,Moderate,Yes," Tabor Pass is located 3.95 miles from Lincoln Creek Road in the Collegiate Peaks Wilderness. The Tabor Creek Trail runs through long stretches of alpine meadow with several large tarns up to the pass. While grades are generally moderate, the trail fades considerably past 2.75 miles and route finding may be necessary in the upper valley. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Have a map and general understanding of the route before setting out. Cairns offer guidance, but are inconsistently placed and can be difficult to spot in open tundra. Fortunately the trail tends to follow the best available terrain and most intuitive route, which greatly helps navigation. Snow cover will compound any challenges, so consider waiting until mid-summer if uncomfortable in these conditions. GPS points given here are useful, but your on-trail experience may differ slightly. Visitors will enjoy expansive alpine landscapes, abundant flowers and great views to and from the pass. Tabor Lake and Truro Lake are accessible from the trail and pass (respectively) with good route finding skills: The trail immediately crosses Lincoln Creek and rises steeply beside a deep gulch to aqueduct road (.3 miles : 10,590'). Cross the road and pass the Wilderness Boundary (.35 miles) to Tabor Creek (.62 miles : 10,735'). It crosses the creek, turns south and moderates across broad grassy slopes with an exceptional array of flowers (1.0 miles : 10,975'). The trail runs fast through open slopes and patchy forest before rising steeply past 2.0 miles to the edge of treeline (2.5 miles : 11,605'). It pushes past treeline on rugged, brushy terrain into a big meadow in the upper valley where the trail abruptly fades (2.75 miles : 11,790'). Note this important point for the return hike. Follow cairns left toward the center of the valley to the first of three large tarns (2.93 miles : 11,492'). A steep wall juts into the valley past the largest tarn, which you needn't scale. Simply follow cairns and/or best available terrain (which is fairly smooth and level) around this large feature and hook back to the east side of the upper valley once past it (3.15 miles : 11,930'). Here the upper valley tapers with a clear look at the pass. Stay high on the east valley wall and follow mild-moderate contours to a cairn at the base of the pass (3.8 miles : 12,255'). The trail clarifies and winds up through loose rock to Tabor Pass (3.95 miles : 12,462'). Views from the pass down Tabor Creek are exceptional, though somewhat confined to peaks and the immediate basin on the north side. It's easy to drop to a large tarn at the top of Galena Creek, and continue down a short distance for bigger views of the drainage.

22,Lost Man Loop ,Aspen-Snowmass,8.9,10545,11506,961,Moderate-Strenuous,No," The Lost Man Loop runs 8.9 miles up Lost Man Creek to Lost Man Lake and Lost Man Pass (12,810'), then drops to Independence Lake and follows the Roaring Fork River to Independence Lake Trailhead on Highway 82. Trail Map | Photo Gallery This versatile trail features two high alpine lakes, Lost Man Pass, expansive meadows and connections to Midway Pass and South Fork Pass. The Lost Man Loop can be accessed from two points on Highway 82: The Lost Man Campground and Trailhead or Independence Lake Trailhead. Note the Lost Man Loop is not a true loop - it begins/ends at these trailheads, which are 4 miles apart. You'll either need to walk the road (not advised) or have a two-car shuttle to connect the trailheads. The two starting points offer very different experiences, especially if returning the way you came. The Independence Lake Trailhead provides a shorter, more direct route to the lakes and pass, while the Lost Man Trailhead sends you on a long, gradual climb to the same destinations. Desired distance and difficulty will help you decide which starting point is best. The following description begins at Lost Man Trailhead and travels clockwise: Follow signs left from the trailhead for Lost Man Creek and Midway Creek. The trail arcs to the Midway Creek Trail split (.35 miles : 10,620') and rolls to the edge of Lost Man Reservoir (.55 miles : 10,610'). It levels past the reservoir across broad, open meadows to the Hunter-Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary (1.5 miles : 10,693') and a wide creek crossing, which can be fairly difficult during peak runoff (1.86 miles (10,785'). Once across it resumes a fast pace through intervals of meadow and patchy forest along and above the creek. Grades steepen past 2.5 miles to another creek at 2.9 miles (11,045'), a narrow but swift crossing aided by elevated, slippery logs. The trail rises steadily through an expanding valley and veers steeply up the west wall to the South Fork Pass Trail split (4.1 miles : 11,622'). Take a few steps up this trail to see peaks that frame adjacent drainages. The Lost Man Loop curls SE from South Fork over a big bend in the valley with great views up and down the route. Grades are moderate but the trail is rugged, brushy and muddy as you undulate close to the damp, swale-like valley floor. It gradually rises back through potentially faint but well-traveled meadows and terraces (5.0 miles : 11,725') to Lost Man Lake (6.1 miles : 12,482'). The trail skirts the lake and switchbacks steeply up rugged, loose rock to Lost Man Pass (6.55 miles : 12,810'). Lost Man Pass spans a divisive ridge between the Roaring Fork headwaters (south), and Lost Man Creek drainage (north). Views are outstanding, with hike-able routes that branch off to Geissler Mountain and other points on the Continental Divide. The trail drops off the pass into broad meadows surrounding Independence Lake (7.1 miles : 12,487'). Independence Lake fills a wide alpine bench with a large tarn .1 mile away that's easy to reach and worth exploring. It continues on a steady descent between Twinning Peak (east) and Geissler Mountain (west) to a bridge over the Roaring Fork River (8.42 miles : 11,735'), split for Linkins Lake (8.75 miles : 11,615') and Independence Lake Trailhead on Highway 82 to complete the loop (8.9 miles : 11,506').

23,Midway Pass ,Aspen-Snowmass,8.0,10545,11841,1296,Moderate,Yes," Midway Creek Trail runs miles 8.7 miles from Lost Man Trailhead on Highway 82 to Hunter Flats in the Hunter - Fryingpan Wilderness. Midway Pass (11,841') is located 4 miles from the trailhead between Coleman Creek drainage (south) and Midway Creek drainage (north). Trail Map | Photo Gallery Midway Pass is a compelling and lightly used alternative to the Lost Man Loop, which leaves from the same trailhead and accesses Lost Man Lake and Independence Lake. The pass-approach features expansive alpine meadows with panoramic views across the Maroon Bells, Collegiate Peaks and Hunter-Fryingpan wilderness areas. There are several accessible summits off the main trail, and these big open spaces are particularly good for seeing elk and mountain goats. Note Midway Pass is not the highest point on the trail, and the divide it spans is fairly subtle. Additionally, some maps imply the distance is ~3.1 miles vs. 4.0 miles. This could be attributed to the highest point on the trail, not the actual point where drainages divide: Follow signs left from the trailhead for Lost Man and Midway Creek. The trail arcs around a marshy area to the Midway Creek Trail (.35 miles : 10,620'), which splits left and climbs fast on methodical switchbacks. It rises steadily to the Hunter - Fryingpan Wilderness Boundary (1.4 miles : 11,465') where grades moderate in a thinning forest. Small clearings on this leg offer good camping terrain. The trail emerges from treeline (2.15 miles : 11,760') and crosses willow-covered meadows to the edge of a scenic pond framed by the Collegiate Peaks and Elk Mountains (2.7 miles : 11,970'). It steepens up a wide slope to the trail's high point (3.02 miles : 12,112'), a good turnaround point if limited by time or weather, and split-off point for reaching the 13,033' summit above. The trail continues NW from the crest on a gradual descent with great views over Coleman Creek to Midway Pass (4.0 miles : 11,841'). This last mile can be faint, though cairns help and terrain naturally funnels you in the correct direction. The pass might not be obvious and is only marked by a large cairn and short wood pole, but newly-found views down Midway Creek will confirm your arrival. Terrain remains fairly mild for some time down Midway Creek, and Midway Lake is only 1 mile away as the crow flies from Midway Pass. Midway Creek Trail runs miles 8.7 miles from Lost Man Trailhead on Highway 82 to Hunter Flats in the Hunter - Fryingpan Wilderness. Midway Pass (11,841') is located 4 miles from the trailhead between Coleman Creek drainage (south) and Midway Creek drainage (north).Trail Map | Photo GalleryMidway Pass is a compelling and lightly used alternative to the Lost Man Loop, which leaves from the same trailhead and accesses Lost Man Lake and Independence Lake.

This challenging trek scales four passes over 12,400' with stunning views and long stretches of open alpine travel. Trail Map | Photo Gallery  West Maroon Pass (12,465') Frigid Air Pass (12,405') Trail Rider Pass (12,415') Buckskin Pass (12,462')  Whether tackled as a trail run or a more leisurely 2-3 day trip, advance knowledge of the route will maximize time and ensure a safe and enjoyable outing. While the distance is not overwhelming, steep climbs at high elevation with unpredictable weather are considerable factors. Carry a detailed map to track progress, anticipate passes and target campsites. There are many designated sites along the way, with freedom to improvise under guidelines of the wilderness area (see details below). Contact the Aspen Ranger District (970.925.3445) for the latest conditions, closures, bear canister requirements and other useful tips before heading out. The following description begins at Maroon Lake and travels clockwise on the 4 Pass Loop: 1. MAROON LAKE - WEST MAROON PASS | 6.45 miles 9,580' - 12,465' @ Pass | 2885' net gain | 3115' total gain The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake before rising away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field to the West Maroon Creek - Maroon Snowmass Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Bear left to begin clockwise travel on the loop. The trail levels around Crater Lake to campsites on the far end. It bends S-SW above the inlet and undulates over rockslides at the base of Maroon Bells. It moves quickly up valley and crosses east over West Maroon Creek, where water can be swift during peak runoff (3.65 miles : 10,515'). The trail rises steadily past treeline and crosses back to the west side through tall swaths of willow (4.5 miles : 10,905'). Travel steepens in short intervals through 5.45 (11,525') miles into broad meadows below the pass. It climbs 940' in the last mile on a ramp-like trail to West Maroon Pass (6.45 miles : 12,465'). The pass spans a small notch in the SW corner of the headwall, with great views down West Maroon Creek and the East Fork drainage on the Crested Butte side. 2. WEST MAROON PASS - FRIGID AIR PASS | 2.55 miles 12,465' - 12,405' @ Pass | 60' net loss | 745' total gain This is the shortest pass-to-pass section of the loop, and arguably the easiest. The trail drops from West Maroon Pass to the split for Crested Butte and Frigid Air Pass (7.25 miles : 11,735'). It rises NW across high alpine meadows above the East Fork drainage, a notably airy stretch with great views over the popular thru-hike route to Crested Butte. The trail splits right at a sign for Frigid Air Pass, and the unmarked left fork heads toward Hasley Basin (8.6 miles : 12,035'). Travel steepens on the last .15 miles up to Frigid Air Pass (9.0 miles : 12,405').  Panoramic views include Maroon Bells and Fravert Basin, where you'll spend the next 4.7 miles. 3. FRIGID AIR PASS - NORTH FORK CUTOFF TRAIL | 4.7 miles 12,405' - 10,295' | 2100' net loss | 165' total gain The trail drops quickly from Frigid Air Pass into Fravert Basin, gradually moderating through expansive alpine meadows topped by red hued walls. It reaches treeline at 10.35 miles (11,425'), and edges close to North Fork Creek through brushy intervals with numerous designated campsites. This fast moving, nondescript section is ideal for making up time if not camping in the area. It passes the last site at 11.7 miles (10,870') before dropping steeply beside a waterfall into a wide, level meadow cut by oxbows of the North Fork (12.05 miles : 10,530'). It enters a cluttered forest before emerging in another meadow that funnels you east across the creek (12.9 miles : 12,440'). The trail remains level above a kinetic section of creek to the Geneva Lake - North Fork Cutoff Trail split (13.7 miles : 10,295'). This is the lowest point of the loop (not counting the 1.7 mile leg from Maroon Lake to Crater Lake). 4. NORTH FORK CUTOFF TRAIL - TRAIL RIDER PASS | 2.55 miles 10,295' - 12,415' @ Pass | 2120' net gain | 2210' total gain This strenuous section climbs above the North Fork through aspen groves and grassy slopes to a second split for Geneva Lake (14.8 miles : 11,390'). Note the trail gains 1095' in just 1.1 miles to this junction.  The trail veers right and narrows into a steep gulch, then rises away on switchbacks that moderate across rolling alpine meadows below Trail Rider Pass. The trail skirts a large pond (15.4 miles : 11,710'), the primary water source if camping in the area (small outlying ponds can dry out).  The reprieve ends with a 705', .85 mile climb to Trail Rider Pass (16.25 miles : 12,415'). Views of the route leading up are exceptional, and even more so down the east side of Snowmass Lake. 5. TRAIL RIDER PASS - SNOWMASS LAKE | 2.1 miles 12,415' - 10,980' | 1435' net loss | 55' total gain The trail drops steeply from Trail Rider on winding switchbacks with expanding views over Snowmass Lake and the formidable peaks above it: Snowmass Peak (13,619'), Hagerman Peak (13,841') and Snowmass Mountain (14,092'). It transitions quickly from alpine meadows to willow mats and treeline at 17.75 miles (11,510'). Conditions are rugged over washed out sections and talus leading to the Geneva Lake Trail - Maroon Snowmass Trail split (18.35 miles : 11,040'). Snowmass Lake is a short walk from here (18.37 miles : 10,980'). 6. SNOWMASS LAKE - BUCKSKIN PASS | 3.9 miles 10,980' - 12,462' @ Pass | 1482' net gain | 1670' total gain The trail rises out of the Snowmass Lake basin into a thick forest, then drops to a wide opening along Snowmass Creek. The trail loses clarity leading to a bridge over the creek (19.55 miles : 10,860'); pay close attention on this braided approach. Once over travel gradually steepens on long, methodical switchbacks to treeline, where views open across the Snowmass Creek drainage back to Snowmass Lake (20.05 miles : 11,575'). Grades steepen on a winding course through high alpine meadows before relaxing on the final run to Buckskin Pass (22.25 miles : 12,465'). Buckskin Pass is the most spacious of the four, a long saddle with rangy views across the Elk Range and Snowmass Lake basin (north), and Maroon Bells and Pyramid Peak (south). Look for goats on adjacent slopes and ridges before making the final descent. 7. BUCKSKIN PASS - MAROON LAKE TRAILHEAD | 4.6 miles 12,462' - 9,580' | 2882' net loss | 155' total gain The trail descends winding switchbacks through flower-carpeted slopes to the Willow Lake Trail split (23.9 miles : 11,745'). It narrows into Minnehaha Gulch and a stream crossing to the east side at 24.7 miles (11,030'). It drops quickly through the gulch back to the Maroon Snowmass - West Maroon Creek Trail split (25.1 miles), where you began clockwise travel on the loop. Retrace your steps back to Maroon Lake on a variously rocky-rooted path to complete the 4 Pass Loop (26.8 miles : 9,580'). The 4 Pass Loop runs 26.8 miles through the heart of the Elk Mountains and Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness.

25,Aspen to Crested Butte ,Aspen-Snowmass,10.45,9580,10448,868,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," The West Maroon Creek Trail joins the West Maroon Pass Trail to form a 10.45 mile thru-hike from Aspen to Crested Butte. This feature-filled route is highlighted by Maroon Lake, Crater Lake, West Maroon Pass and arguably one of the finest wildflower displays in Colorado. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The east-west hike begins at Maroon Lake (9,580') outside Aspen and climbs 2,885' to West Maroon Pass (12,465'), then drops through high alpine meadows and moderates above East Fork Crystal River to East Fork of West Maroon Trailhead on the Crested Butte side. See below for shuttle and transportation details to each trailhead. This is a very busy trail corridor with access to all points on the 4 Pass Loop, Snowmass Lake, Willow Lake, Hasley Basin and climbing routes to Maroon Bells and Pyramid Peak. Expect heavy traffic in both directions, especially on summer weekends. Get an early start to experience lighter crowds and avoid storms while coming over the pass. Much of the trail is exposed, even when below treeline. Anticipate variable weather conditions throughout the day, and as you gain and lose elevation: The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake before rising away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field to the West Maroon Creek - Maroon Snowmass Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Bear left for Crater Lake and West Maroon Creek. The trail levels around Crater Lake with access to 11 designated campsites. It bends S-SW above the inlet and undulates over rockslides at the base of Maroon Bells. It moves quickly up valley and crosses east over West Maroon Creek, where water can be swift (3.65 miles : 10,515').

The pass spans a small notch in the SW corner of the headwall with great views down West Maroon Creek and the East Fork drainage on the Crested Butte side. The trail drops from West Maroon Pass on steep switchbacks to the Frigid Air Pass split at the top of the East Fork drainage (7.25 miles : 11,735'). The West Maroon Pass Trail splits left, bends W-SW and moderates through high alpine meadows to the north side of the valley. These sunny south-facing slopes support one of the most prolific wildflower displays in Colorado, which continues virtually uninterrupted for the next 3 miles. You'll pass an unmarked split at 8.45 miles (11,155') which breaks north for Hasley Basin, a compelling diversion that scales a pass and drops into the North Fork drainage to join the 4 Pass Loop. Travel eases on a steady descent (save one steep rise from 9 - 9.5 miles) through the open valley until the forest re-constitutes at the Wilderness Boundary (10.12 miles : 10,590'). It drops in short intervals to the East Fork of West Maroon Trailhead in Schofield Park (10.45 miles : 10,448'). Crested Butte to Aspen Return Hike The hike from Crested Butte to Aspen is considered easier because it's shorter, starts higher and follows a relatively smooth path all the way up to the pass. The descent to Maroon Lake is particularly rocky with several stream crossings and potential for deep mud in places. The trail runs 4.0 miles and 2,017' up to the pass, and 6.45 miles down to Maroon Lake. Total elevation gain is approximately 2,460' in this direction.

It's one of nine passes over 12,000' in the wilderness, and arguably easiest to reach. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Buckskin spans a divisive ridge between Minnehaha Gulch (east) and the Snowmass Creek drainage (west). Views are among the most inclusive on this trail network, highlighted by the Maroon Bells, Pyramid Peak, Snowmass Lake, Snowmass Mountain and distinct red-white hues of the Elk Range. Unlike other passes that thread fragile crags between valleys, Buckskin is fairly broad with room to explore. Scan nearby ridges for mountain goat, which are common in this area. Visitors will enjoy high alpine landscapes and iconic Colorado scenery on the hike to Buckskin Pass: The Maroon Snowmass Trail begins on a level path up the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It rises away in thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). Pick your way through talus back into the forest, where it crests and drops to the West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Crater Lake is a quick and worthwhile excursion from this point. The Maroon Snowmass Trail steepens considerably over Crater Lake and bends NW up Minnehaha Gulch. Enjoy great morning light on the Bells and Sleeping Sexton on this rapid climb. The trail crosses a rocky stream channel (2.95 miles : 11,030') to a meadow, then funnels up a shallow gulch that opens over treeline (3.45 miles : 11,480). Note camping is not permitted in these meadows. The trail resumes a steep, sinuous course to the Willow Lake Trail split (3.8 miles : 11,745'), where it breaks NW on a twisting path up flower-covered slopes to Buckskin Pass (4.6 miles : 12,462').

27,Crater Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,3.6,9580,10076,496,Easy-Moderate,Yes,"  Crater Lake is located 1.8 miles from Maroon Lake in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. Crater Lake formed as glaciers retreated and left flat, open spaces where water collected in a process called glacial benching. Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	Both Maroon and Crater lakes contain notably high nutrient levels, which contributes to algae growth that creates a unique blue-green hue. Brook, rainbow and brown trout naturally occur in these lakes and their tributaries (Maroon Lake is stocked and also contains Colorado River cutthroat).  This short but scenic hike is ideal for families or those with limited time. Visitors will enjoy mild grades, abundant wildflowers and great fishing on the hike to Crater Lake: 	The Maroon Snowmass Trail begins on a level path up the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It continues above the inlet area into thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). 	Pick your way through talus back into the forest, where it crests and drops to the West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Bear left to Crater Lake (1.8 miles : 10,076'). 	The West Maroon Creek Trail levels around the north shore to the open outlet area before steepening up-valley. This wide area is cut by lazy oxbows of West Maroon Creek, and is worth exploring.

28,Snowmass Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,17.0,9580,10980,1400,Strenuous,Yes," Snowmass Lake is located 8.5 miles from Maroon Lake in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness. It lies at treeline in a massive cirque framed by Snowmass Peak (13,619'), Hagerman Peak (13,841') and Snowmass Mountain (14,092'). It's among the largest alpine lakes in the Wilderness, and one of many highlights on the 4-Pass Loop. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Snowmass Lake is accessible from either end of the 16.8-mile Maroon Snowmass Trail; the following description begins at Maroon Lake and scales Buckskin Pass (12,462'), the more popular and arguably most scenic route. This travel corridor sees heavy traffic so expect crowds, honor campfire restrictions and reduce impact by staying on trails, using established sites and leaving no trace of your visit: The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It rises away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). Pick your way through talus to a crest and drop to the Maroon Snowmass - West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Crater Lake is a quick and worthwhile excursion from the split. The Maroon Snowmass Trail steepens over Crater Lake and bends NW up Minnehaha Gulch. Enjoy great morning light on the Bells and Sleeping Sexton on this rapid and rugged climb. The trail crosses a rocky stream channel (2.95 miles : 11,030') to a meadow, then funnels up a shallow gulch that opens over treeline (3.45 miles : 11,480). Note camping is not permitted in these meadows. Buckskin Pass is now in sight, and Willow Pass is concealed in the upper valley. The trail resumes a steep, sinuous course to the Willow Lake Trail split (3.8 miles : 11,745'), where it breaks NW on a twisting path up flower-covered slopes to Buckskin Pass (4.6 miles : 12,462'). Buckskin Pass spans a divisive ridge between Minnehaha Gulch (east) and the Snowmass Creek drainage (west). Views are terrific with room to maneuver and examine distinct rock types of the Elk Range. Scan nearby ridges for mountain goat, which are common in this area. Snowmass Lake is now visible with a bird's eye view of the long route leading to it. The trail drops NW from the pass on more moderate grades back into treeline (5.9 miles : 11,575'). Scenery enjoyed from the pass is now lost on a business-like descent to a wide, marshy section of Snowmass Creek. It reaches the far-end of this oxbow-cut space and turns sharply left on a bridge over the creek (7.25 miles : 10,860'). It skirts the opening and rises on switchbacks into thick timber, undulating to consecutive splits for Geneva Lake (8.28 and 8.38 miles). A map is useful here, as you now have options for reaching the lake or skipping it altogether. Follow signs in each case to Snowmass Lake (8.5 miles : 10,980'). The lake is nearly .75 miles long and several hundred yards wide, with iconic peaks and vertical walls framing the west side. The east side is ringed by patchy forest and easier to explore. Backpackers seeking privacy should consider backtracking, or continuing north on the Maroon Snowmass Trail to nice sites just below the basin.

This stunning pass is the most commonly used route for thru-hikers between Aspen and Crested Butte, and the first encountered when traveling clockwise on the 4-Pass Loop. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The West Maroon Creek Trail rises steadily between iconic peaks into the capacious upper valley, where grades steepen on a ramp-like path etched in the west wall to the pass: The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It rises away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070'). Pick your way through talus to a crest, and drop to the Maroon Snowmass - West Maroon Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 10,110'). Bear left and level up the west side of Crater Lake to the first group of campsites on the far end (2.0 miles : 10,110'). The trail bends S-SW over the inlet and undulates across rockslides at the base of Maroon Bells, with high points offering great views back at Crater Lake and Pyramid Peak (3.0 miles : 10,295'). It moves quickly up valley under the Len Shoemaker Ridge and crosses east over West Maroon Creek (3.65 miles : 10,515'). Water can be swift during peak runoff, but is generally not an obstacle. The trail rises steadily before clearing the balance of treeline with your first full view of the red-hued headwall and pass in the SW corner (4.45 miles : 10,880'). It crosses West Maroon Creek back to the west side (4.5 miles : 10,905'), weaving through tall willow patches and flower-filled glades. Scan the upper valley for wildlife as you progress - you'll likely see anything that moves in this big, open space. Travel steepens in short intervals through 5.45 (11,525') miles into an idyllic landscape under the pass. Views are astonishing as it climbs 945' in the last mile on a ramp-like trail to West Maroon Pass (6.45 miles : 12,465'). Be mindful of footing on this narrow, potentially unstable approach. The pass spans a small notch in the SW corner of the headwall with exceptional views across West Maroon Creek valley, and down East Fork drainage on the Crested Butte side.

30,Willow Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,12.4,9580,11795,2215,Strenuous,Yes," Willow Lake is located 6.2 miles from Maroon Lake in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. It lies just above treeline in a stunning alpine basin east of Willow Pass (12,572'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery While the lake is exceptional, the hike itself is equally compelling. It follows the Maroon Snowmass Trail with iconic backdrops to the meadows under Buckskin Pass, where the Willow Lake Trail splits for Willow Pass and an airy descent to the lake. This segment is not connected to most other backpacking routes in the area, and sees lighter traffic. It's also one of the few over-and-back pass hikes that can be completed in a day, though time management is important with an exposed climb on the return. Visitors will enjoy open landscapes, light crowds and a chance to explore Willow Creek, one of the longest and least visited drainages in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness: The trail begins on the north side of Maroon Lake to the Scenic Loop split (.3 miles). It rises away into thick aspens that break across an open rock field on the valley floor (1.2 miles : 10,070').

The Maroon Snowmass Trail steepens considerably over Crater Lake and bends NW up Minnehaha Gulch. Enjoy great morning light on the Bells and Sleeping Sexton on this rapid climb. The trail crosses a rocky stream channel (2.95 miles : 11,030') to a meadow, then funnels up a shallow gulch that opens in a gorgeous alpine setting (3.45 miles : 11,480). Note camping is not permitted in these meadows. Buckskin Pass is in sight, but Willow Pass is hidden by a ridge. The trail resumes a steep, sinuous path to the Willow Lake Trail split (3.8 miles : 11,745'), which breaks north on similar terrain with stunning views down valley. Scan these high slopes and meadows for goat, sheep and elk. It levels briefly on the rim of a large bowl in the upper valley (4.2 miles : 12,075'), crosses a stream and arcs up the bowl's right side to the base of the pass (4.55 miles : 12,315'). Here it climbs 257' in just .15 miles to Willow Pass, a small notch in the craggy walls between drainages (4.7 miles : 12,572'). The pass offers rangy views over the route leading to it, and across Willow Creek basin. Willow Lake and large outlying ponds can also be seen from the pass. The descent is initially steep, but gradually moderates through high alpine meadows rife with flowers. It drops gently to the East Snowmass Trail split (5.5 miles : 12,005'), a faint point marked by a low-lying sign that can be obscured by snow or brush. The trail continues on a rolling, narrow-cut path that may lose clarity on the final approach, though the lake's location is never in question. It laces through krummholz-topped knolls to the north side of Willow Lake (6.2 miles : 11,795'), an expansive area that begs exploration.

31,Haystack Mountain ,Aspen-Snowmass,12.9,8408,12206,3798,Strenuous,Yes," Haystack Mountain (12,206') is located 6.45 miles from Maroon Snowmass Trailhead in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. Its broad, flat summit tops a divisive ridge between the Capitol Creek and West Snowmass Creek drainages, just north of a saddle under Mount Daly (13,305'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery This challenging and lightly used trail rises through steep intervals of aspen and alpine meadows to the saddle (11,752'), where you'll branch off and improvise .35 miles and 454' up to the summit. Postcard-like meadows span the saddle between Haystack and Mount Daly, with exceptional views that include Mount Sopris, Capitol Peak and the Maroon Bells. Wildflowers and wildlife are particularly abundant in this rich alpine expanse. Crossing Snowmass Creek can be difficult through mid-summer, and portions of the trail are vague with several unmarked forks at critical points. Good fitness and navigation skills are necessary. Lingering snow may compound any difficulty you encounter. Alternatively you can reach West Snowmass Trail from the Capitol Creek and Nickelson Creek trails, with simpler navigation but equally challenging climbs. Contact the Aspen Ranger District for current road and trail conditions, which may influence your starting point and route: The trail rises over Snowmass Falls Ranch through tall aspen to a second cattle gate where the forest opens with views of Snowmass Creek (1.1 miles : 8,648'). It levels on a high bank to the West Snowmass Trail split (1.45 miles : 8,638'), which switchbacks down to Snowmass Creek (1.52 miles : 8,600'). The creek is wide and runs swiftly through mid-summer; poles can be useful on this ford. Once across follow National Forest signs through a big meadow with views up to Clark Peak (13,568'). Note this is private property, so it's important to stay on the designated trail. It crosses the meadow into bands of aspen where you'll keep straight past several bisecting paths to another cattle gate (1.9 miles :  8,780'). Travel intensifies past the gate on a rugged, shifting path under a tall aspen canopy. Keep left at a fork (2.0 miles) where grades steepen to a high bank over a tributary  (2.5 miles : 9,235'). It levels and arcs across the drainage before climbing steeply again to a small meadow (3.18 miles : 9,595'). Travel eases to another meadow (3.45 miles : 9,710') and crosses the base of a steep slope to an unmarked fork (3.85 miles : 9,957'). The left fork drops into a large meadow along West Snowmass Creek where you can pick up an informal route leading to its source at Moon Lake. The right fork quickly fades, leaving few good options. The following description and distances from this point assume you're able to find a creative route to the next point where the trail clarifies .3 miles away. Note this is a direct line, so your actual travel distance may be longer. Cut through heavy brush and steep slopes to regain the trail on a high clearing (4.15 miles : 10,230'). The trail here is narrow and may be overgrown by tall brush. Once on track it steepens to another unmarked fork (4.48 miles) - stay right. The trail runs along the base of an open slope before turning up on a steep, winding climb to the Nickelson Creek Trail split (4.95 miles : 10,825'), a welcome sign confirming you're on track. Travel briefly moderates past the split across steep meadows with great views of Mount Daly. It rises quickly through alpine glades and pockets of spruce to a meadow in the upper basin where the trail fades. Follow a cairn (5.5 miles : 11,295') and faint track across the meadow to regain the trail, which resumes steep, winding travel past treeline to the Pass (6.1 miles : 11,752'). The pass spans a broad meadow with great views down Capitol Creek, the Daly-Capitol Peak ridge line and (right) up to Haystack.  Break off the trail here and head north on a .35 mile - 454' scramble up to Haystack Mountain (6.45 miles : 12,206'). The scramble is steep but rock-free and easy to find an efficient route. The summit is broad and flat with incredible views that extend from Mount Sopris to Maroon Bells. Tread lightly across these delicate tundra meadows. Mount Daly (13,305') stands prominently across the pass with Capitol Peak (14,130') nudging higher just behind it.

No maintained trail reaches the lakes, however a strenuous and navigationally challenging route follows Snowmass Creek and Bear Creek up to the basin. Only experienced hikers should attempt this route. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The hike can be tackled in five parts:  The Maroon Snowmass Trail to Snowmass Creek (GPS points 1-8) Snowmass Creek ford into the Bear Creek drainage (GPS points 9 - 10) Unmaintained route up Bear Creek to the waterfall (GPS points 10 - 12) Scaling the waterfall (GPS points 12 - 16) Waterfall up to the Pierre Lakes (GPS points 16 - 26)  Distances and GPS points provided here are only a guide and individual routes will vary. The route generally follows an old trail of which parts are still clear or intuitively followed. Other segments follow cairns though you'll likely find multiple sets. Navigation is much easier past treeline where you can simply trace the creek. Arguably the biggest challenge is the waterfall on Bear Creek. It's steep and requires some Class-3 scrambling and bushwhacking through cheese grater-like brush. It can take 1 - 2 hours (each way) to clear the waterfall. Cairns offer guidance but are easily lost and difficult to follow. This description runs up the right side of the waterfall, and acknowledges but can't attest to possible routes up the left side. Travel is generally rugged once off the main trail with heavy brush and long sections of rock, especially leading up to the waterfall and across the Pierre Lakes basin. These sections slow travel and should factor in to your schedule. Visitors will enjoy stunning scenery throughout that few people have a chance to see: Maroon Snowmass Trail to Snowmass Creek (GPS points 1-8) The trail rises through tall aspen to views over Snowmass Creek (1.1 miles : 8,648'). It levels on a high bank to the West Snowmass Trail split (1.45 miles : 8,638') and runs fast on mild grades in a thick aspen forest. You'll generally want to cross Snowmass Creek as close to Bear Creek as possible to avoid unnecessary bushwhacking on the far side, but it's difficult to discern this drainage from Copper Creek (approximately .12 miles before Bear Creek). Some trip reports suggest there's a bridge over Snowmass Creek near the ideal cross-point, but it's hard to find and its condition can't be verified. One efficient point is approximately 3.7 miles up the Maroon Snowmass Trail. This approximate location will place you near the mouth of Bear Creek on the north side where you'll find the designated route. Snowmass Creek ford into the Bear Creek drainage (GPS points 9 - 10) Leave the main trail and head down to Snowmass Creek (approx. 3.7 miles : 9,125').  Snowmass Creek is voluminous, especially during runoff. Prioritize safe crossing over location - once over the best available terrain will naturally funnel you into the Bear Creek drainage and up the north side. Some trip reports suggest crossing before or just after Copper Creek. It seems unnecessary to cross that early unless volume is prohibitive near Bear Creek. A decent track leads from Snowmass Creek into the drainage where navigation is fairly straightforward up to the waterfall. Unmaintained route up Bear Creek to the waterfall (GPS points 11 - 13)  The unmaintained route runs along Bear Creek through intervals of meadow, open rock, tall brush and timber (4.3 mile mark). Terrain is uneven but grades are generally moderate with easy navigation along the creek. Raspberries are abundant across open slopes. Be mindful of bears, especially where visibility is limited. You'll reach a big opening in the valley at the edge of a long rock slide from which you'll see the waterfall (4.9 miles : 9,640'). Cross this rocky section to a swath of willow between you and the base of the falls (5.2 miles : 9,850'). You can climb up / around this rugged (and deceptively long) segment, but it's advisable to stay low and punch through to the far side where you'll find cairns leading up the right side of the waterfall (5.25 miles : 9,850'). Scaling the waterfall (GPS points 13 - 16) Cairns head straight up with Class-III scrambling in places. You'll likely lose one route and pick up another by following natural lines and best available terrain. Dense brush can present a bigger challenge than rock or pitch on this scramble - the best way is often a hard-nosed punch right through it. The route climbs 600'+ across boulders, open ledges and brush before tilting back down to glades above the waterfall (note the waterfall isn't 600' tall, but the route leads you higher to avoid cliffs). Head toward the creek where a good path will soon emerge (5.55 miles : 10,560').  Mark your transition point from brush to glades because it's difficult to find on the return. The waterfall descent is equally challenging and time consuming. Routing is especially important on the return, as it's possible to get cliffed-out and backtracking is difficult. Waterfall up to the basin (GPS points 16 - 26) Once above the waterfall travel moderates to another long, open rockslide (6.0 miles : 10,570'). The valley is flat here but the center is cluttered by willow, forcing you up the rock. Head straight across to find a grassy track that leads to a well-marked creek crossing (6.4 miles : 10,790'). This is where Bear Creek forks and the route crosses the north fork to a steep ridge between forks (the north fork leads to the lower lakes, and the south fork leads to the largest lake). It follows cairns up this steep ridge while favoring the south side and losing sight of the north side (GPS points 19 - 22). Cairns seem to disappear as timber thins and big meadows along the south fork of Bear Creek emerge below (7.1 miles : 11,570').  Both routing and terrain become much easier as you pass treeline (7.2 miles : 11,525') into alpine meadows along the south fork of Bear Creek. Follow the creek to a steep rocky ridge (8.1 miles), which you'll scale to reach the Pierre Lakes basin (8.2 miles : 12,174'). The Pierre Lakes occupy a massive, rocky basin below Capitol Peak (14,130') and Clark Peak (13,568') in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. No maintained trail reaches the lakes, however a strenuous and navigationally challenging route follows Snowmass Creek and Bear Creek up to the basin. Only experienced hikers should attempt this route.Trail Map | Photo GalleryThe hike can be tackled in five parts:Distances and GPS points provided here are only a guide and individual routes will vary.The route generally follows an old trail of which parts are still clear or intuitively followed.

33,Blue Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,4.4,10758,12435,1677,Moderate,Yes," Blue Lake (12,435') is located 2.2 miles from North Fork of Lake Creek Trailhead off Highway 82 in the Mount Massive Wilderness. It's part of the area's last private in-holding that was acquired by the Wilderness Land Trust in 2012 and transferred to the National Forest Service. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Blue Lake fills a steep-walled bowl just east of the Continental Divide below Twinning Peak (13,711'). This moderate hike follows the North Fork of Lake Creek before splitting off on a steep climb through treeline to the lake. It fades on the final approach but routing is intuitive across open terrain. Visitors will enjoy light crowds, great fishing and quick access to high alpine landscapes on the hike to Blue Lake: The trail begins on a flat road bed that narrows up to a stream at the Mount Massive Wilderness Boundary (.71 miles : 11,018'). This is Blue Lake's outlet, which you'll follow to the lake. Cross the stream and immediately begin looking for a faint fork on your left (.75 miles : 11,025').  Bear left at this sparingly marked point, just past which travel clarifies on a very steep, twisting climb up the right side of the creek. It gains 700' in .5 miles before clearing treeline and moderating in a big alpine valley below the lake (1.25 miles : 11,715'). The trail rises up the right (east) side of the valley and gradually loses clarity (1.8 miles : 12,140'). Cairns offer guidance and you'll likely find multiple sets - some lead higher up the valley wall and others run low closer to the outlet stream. Both options are viable though the higher route tends to be drier. The final approach levels across big meadows to Blue Lake (2.2 miles : 12,435'). Soft alpine grasses surround the open SE side with gentle slopes that offer great aerial views across the basin.

34,North Fork Trail ,Aspen-Snowmass,8.1,10795,12438,1643,Moderate,Yes," The North Fork Trail runs 4.05 miles through a broad, glacially carved valley to Fryingpan Pass (12,438') in the Mount Massive Wilderness. The pass spans a rocky saddle on the Continental Divide under Deer Mountain between the Fryingpan River and North Fork Lake Creek drainages. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The approach travels up a classic U-shaped valley topped by 13,000' peaks and a large tarn just below the pass. There are many good places to camp and fish in the lower valley before a strenuous climb up the headwall.  The North Fork Trailhead is located 4.5 miles east of Independence Pass on Highway 82 between Aspen and Leadville, just far enough away from each to be overlooked. Visitors will enjoy lighter crowds and stunning alpine landscapes on the North Fork Trail: The trail begins on a flat road bed that narrows up to a stream and the Mount Massive Wilderness Boundary (.71 miles : 11,018'). Hop the stream and continue on mild grades between thin bands of timber and the North Fork of Lake Creek. It levels from 1.3 - 2.4 miles across broad meadows under steep, open slopes ideal for glassing wildlife.  The trail weaves through willow leading to the west branch of the creek, which you'll cross (right) and rise up a subtle ridge between branches of the North Fork (2.4 miles : 11,540'). Note that after a brief time the route will follow the east branch up to the pass. Grades steepen through treeline along the east branch to a big grassy basin under the headwall (3.3 miles : 11,880'). Follow cairns to the base, where you'll climb nearly 500' in .5 miles to a large tarn just below the pass (3.85 miles : 12,378').  The cairn-marked trail may lose clarity across this rocky basin, but it's a clear and easy scramble from here to Fryingpan Pass (4.05 miles : 12,438'). Views down both valleys are exceptional, and an unmaintained but intuitive route continues into the Fryingpan drainage to join a maintained trail at Fryingpan Lakes.  Deer Mountain (13,761') stands prominently over the pass, with a similar basin and tarn between it and Mount Champion (13,646') that can be reached with modest effort.

35,Viewline Trail to Skyline Ridge Trail ,Aspen-Snowmass,8.1,7905,8514,609,Moderate,No," Sky Mountain Park covers 2500 acres of newly designated open space between the Owl Creek and Brush Creek valleys in Snowmass. 30 miles of existing and in-development trails run through 5 natural vegetation types:  Mountain Shrublands (57%) Sagebrush Shrublands (22%) Shale Barrens (9.5%) Riparian Corridors (2.7%) Aspen-Douglas Fir Forests (1.75%)  This diverse composite offers critical winter range and migration habitat for elk and mule deer. Badger, mountain lion, bear and scores of birds have also been documented in the Park. Several trailheads access Sky Mountain Park with many connection points for creating loops, out-and-backs and reaching Aspen. Trail Map | Photo Gallery  The Viewline Trail joins the Skyline Ridge Trail to form an 8.1 mile and-and-back route along the Park's high central ridge with big views that range from Mount Sopris to Aspen Highlands. Clean singletrack and mild grades suit mountain bikes, runners and families of all abilities. Dawn and dusk travelers stand a good chance of seeing wildlife in this active area. The following description accesses the Viewline Trail from Highline Trailhead on Highline Road, just steps up from the roundabout in Snowmass Village. There's no parking at the trailhead - use free parking at Town Center and walk .1 mile to the trailhead: The Highline Trail winds .23 miles up to a Map Board and 3-way fork. The Viewline Trail (middle fork) splits up and to the right of the Ditchline Trail and winds tightly through tall crowns of gambel oak and mountain mahogany. Mount Daly (13,305') and Capitol Peak (14,130') stand prominently over Snowmass Village with expanding views across the valley and Elk Mountains. The Viewline Trail rises quickly on a sinuous path that gradually straightens to a crest and the Deadline Trail - Skyline Ridge Trail junction (1.95 miles : 8,595'). The Skyline Ridge Trail continues straight and dips down across broad sage flats dotted with paintbrush, lupine, phlox and balsamroot. It rolls to the base of a steep knoll (3.0 miles : 8,565') and wraps NE to a high thin ridge with great views over Owl Creek. Look for elk that gather in these pastoral meadows from April - late June. It winds steeply down then undulates moderately along the ridge to the Airline - Cozyline Trail split (3.95 miles : 8,475'). The Skyline Ridge Trail continues to its terminus at Cozy Point on Radar Road above the Aspen Airport (4.05 miles : 8,514'). Those seeking longer and more varied routes on the return can split off on the Cozyline-Cozy Point Loop or Daedline Trail, both of which will return you to the Viewline and Skyline Ridge Trails.

It climbs 600' in the first 1.3 miles to a high point over the valley, then moderates along a diversely vegetated ridge with panoramas across Snowmass Village and the Roaring Fork Valley. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Runners and mountain bikers will enjoy smooth single track the entire way, and option to extend travel on the Rim Trail - North. The Rim Trail - South is a great alternative to the Government Trail and its connectors when closed for elk calving mid-May to late-June: The trail begins on a moderately steep climb through scrub oak and sage with rapidly expanding views over Snowmass Village. It winds methodically up to the trail's highest point (1.3 miles : 9,212') with stunning views of Mount Daly (13,305') and Capitol Peak (14,130'). Ignore spurs branching right just before gaining the ridge, as they'll join the main trail but eschew this amazing backdrop. The trail turns sharply east off the apex and dips into pockets of aspen and fir on the north side of the ridge. Note contrasting ecological compositions as you toggle between north and south slopes from this point on. Travel moderates on a rolling descent through intervals of aspen, conifer and scrub oak through 2.5 miles (8,885') where views of Wildcat Reservoir open to the north. The trail edges back to the spine (3.0 miles : 8,718') and splits at a sign for easy and difficult terrain (3.48 miles : 8,535').

37,Sunnyside ,Aspen-Snowmass,11.2,7845,10061,2216,Moderate,Yes," The Sunnyside Trail joins the Shadyside Trail to form an 11.2 mile lollipop loop up and around the summit of Red Mountain in Aspen. The Sunnyside Trail climbs 1900' in 3 miles up the SW flank to reach the loop, which runs 5.2 miles through long intervals of aspen and mixed conifers just below the summit. Trail Map | Photo Gallery This busy trail system features stunning views across the Roaring Fork Valley from Mount Sopris to Ajax Mountain, with several iconic peaks in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness in the backdrop. Smooth, neatly cut singletrack offers mountain bikes and runners ideal conditions on this ecologically varied route. Distance Note: There's a connector trail that cuts a 'chord' across the Loop that can shorten distance and difficulty. This connector trail is also called 'Sunnyside'. Distance discrepancies between sources can in part be attributed to custom routing. The following description travels counter-clockwise on the loop, taking each trail segment in full: The trail rises from Cemetery Lane to a cairn leading right (.35 miles) - don't miss this important split. It continues on long-leg switchbacks in a scrub oak ecosystem with views that extend across the Snowmass, Buttermilk, Aspen Highlands and Ajax Mountain ski areas. The trail crosses a road (left) and quickly departs right at 1.33 miles (8,530'). It climbs methodically through diminutive brush until passing a radio tower (2.4 miles) and leveling across an aspen-ringed glade (2.55 miles : 9,405'). It rises back into a cluttered forest that opens upon reaching the Shadyside Trail split and beginning of the loop (3.0 miles : 9,752'). Keep right on the Sunnyside Trail for counter-clockwise travel. The Sunnyside Trail heads SE on level contours below the summit across aspen-studded slopes to the Sunnyside connector trail (3.5 miles : 9,740'), which you can take to shorten the loop. Long stretches of aspen mix with spruce and fir along mild grades for the better part of the next two miles. The trail gradually bends NE to a small clearing at the Shadyside - Repeater Road Trail junction (5.52 miles : 10,010'). Signs point left onto the 4WD Road for Shadyside, which quickly departs (right) back onto singletrack. Follow signs for the Shadyside Trail closely. The Shadyside Trail drops in a thick forest to a boggy pond and Sunnyside Trail split (6.55 miles : 9,770'), which as before can be taken to shorten the loop. The Shadyside Trail continues descending through nondescript conifers that conceal large openings in the forest. Take a few steps off trail to explore these interesting spaces. It gradually curls S-SW with partial views to a marked fork (7.4 miles : 9,445') - anticipate this sudden split which leads up and to the left. The trail undulates on a S-SW heading back to the first Sunnyside - Shadyside split to complete the loop (8.2 miles : 9,752'). Retrace your steps on the Sunnyside Trail to the trailhead on Cemetery Lane (11.2 miles : 7,845'). The Sunnyside Trail joins the Shadyside Trail to form an 11.2 mile lollipop loop up and around the summit of Red Mountain in Aspen. The Sunnyside Trail climbs 1900' in 3 miles up the SW flank to reach the loop, which runs 5.2 miles through long intervals of aspen and mixed conifers just below the summit.Trail Map | Photo GalleryThis busy trail system features stunning views across the Roaring Fork Valley from Mount Sopris to Ajax Mountain, with several iconic peaks in the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness in the backdrop.

Distance discrepancies between sources can in part be attributed to custom routing.The following description travels counter-clockwise on the loop, taking each trail segment in full:The trail rises from Cemetery Lane to a cairn leading right (.35 miles) - don't miss this important split. It continues on long-leg switchbacks in a scrub oak ecosystem with views that extend across the Snowmass, Buttermilk, Aspen Highlands and Ajax Mountain ski areas.The trail crosses a road (left) and quickly departs right at 1.33 miles (8,530'). It climbs methodically through diminutive brush until passing a radio tower (2.4 miles) and leveling across an aspen-ringed glade (2.55 miles : 9,405').It rises back into a cluttered forest that opens upon reaching the Shadyside Trail split and beginning of the loop (3.0 miles : 9,752'). Keep right on the Sunnyside Trail for counter-clockwise travel.The Sunnyside Trail heads SE on level contours below the summit across aspen-studded slopes to the Sunnyside connector trail (3.5 miles : 9,740'), which you can take to shorten the loop. Long stretches of aspen mix with spruce and fir along mild grades for the better part of the next two miles.The trail gradually bends NE to a small clearing at the Shadyside - Repeater Road Trail junction (5.52 miles : 10,010'). Signs point left onto the 4WD Road for Shadyside, which quickly departs (right) back onto singletrack. Follow signs for the Shadyside Trail closely.The Shadyside Trail drops in a thick forest to a boggy pond and Sunnyside Trail split (6.55 miles : 9,770'), which as before can be taken to shorten the loop. The Shadyside Trail continues descending through nondescript conifers that conceal large openings in the forest. Take a few steps off trail to explore these interesting spaces.It gradually curls S-SW with partial views to a marked fork (7.4 miles : 9,445') - anticipate this sudden split which leads up and to the left.The trail undulates on a S-SW heading back to the first Sunnyside - Shadyside split to complete the loop (8.2 miles : 9,752'). Retrace your steps on the Sunnyside Trail to the trailhead on Cemetery Lane (11.2 miles : 7,845').",39.215616666667,-106.842166666667,205.56666666666666
38,Thomas Lakes ,Aspen-Snowmass,7.6,8665,10248,1583,Moderate,Yes," The Thomas Lakes are located 3.8 miles from Dinkle Lake Road at the base of Mount Sopris in the Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness. The first lake fills a steep walled bowl that forms Prince Creek; the second lies .2 miles away in a level, more accessible basin. Trail Map | Photo Gallery This feature-filled trail passes through mountain shrublands, high meadows and tall aspen stands to the lakes. It continues 4 miles and 2800' up to Mount Sopris, and many hikers will basecamp at Thomas Lakes en route to the summit. Camping and campfires are allowed in 13 designated sites within 1/4 mile of the lakes. Dispersed camping is otherwise permitted in outlying areas of the White River National Forest and Maroon Bells - Snowmass Wilderness (see below for details). This is a busy trail corridor, especially on summer weekends - arrive early to secure choice campsites at Thomas Lakes: The trail climbs steadily in mixed timber to a gate (1.15 miles : 9,230'). It bends south and levels across open shrubland slopes with great views down W. Sopris Creek and out to Hay Park. These sunny slopes are a good place to see flowers and anything moving about. Bear right at the Hay Park - Thomas Lakes Trail split (1.7 miles : 9,370') and rise through open space to an elevated meadow with great views of Mount Sopris (2.0 miles : 9,595'). The trail enters a tall aspen forest and moderates to a string of glades (2.9 miles : 9,850') that open to big meadows along Prince Creek (3.2 miles : 9,980'). It crosses Prince Creek and passes between a pond and large clearing (3.5 miles : 10,135') to the Maroon Bells Wilderness Boundary and first Thomas Lake (3.8 miles : 10,197'). The trail forks here to designated campsites - follow signs for Mount Sopris to reach the second Thomas Lake (4.0 miles : 10,248'). The first lake is ringed by rugged talus that can limit exploration. Improvise across the outlet to open-rock shores where you'll find few people, excellent views and raspberries popping through the talus. The second lake fills a level (albeit rocky) basin with good access for anglers and more room to explore.

40,Hope Pass ,Aspen-Snowmass,9.0,9305,12508,3203,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," Hope Pass (12,508') is located 4.5 miles from Willis Gulch Trailhead in the San Isabel National Forest. This short but steep route begins off Highway 82 and joins the Continental Divide Trail up Little Willis Gulch to a saddle between Quail Mountain (13,461') and Mount Hope (13,933'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery Views extend from Twin Lakes into the Collegiate Peaks, and both Quail Mountain and Mount Hope are challenging but fairly straight-forward walk-ups (Hope is decidedly more difficult). The CDT continues south from Hope Pass down Sheep Gulch to County Road #390. Visitors will enjoy diverse forests, cascading creeks and big alpine landscapes on the way to Hope Pass: From the parking lot, cross the bridge over Lake Creek and head straight on a path through tall brush. Ignore social trails that branch off along the creek. Follow signs for Big and Little Willis Gulch #1471 that lead over beaver ponds to the Upper Twin Lake split (.37 miles : 9,435'). Here grades steepen through young aspen on a long SE arc into the gulch (1.0 miles : 9,835'). Travel moderates to a bridge (1.35 miles : 9,893') where it joins the CDT and steepens considerably in a tall, mixed forest beside the creek. There are many cascades on this stretch, though you'll have to work to see the most kinetic ones. The trail climbs 385' from the bridge to the Little Willis - Big Willis Gulch Trail split (1.8 miles : 10,278'); bear left up Little Willis and resume steep climbing that gradually eases in a wide, flat piece of forest above the gulch (2.5 - 3.0 miles : 10,910' - 11,200'). It steepens back in a high, patchy forest before emerging through treeline in a postcard-like basin in the upper valley (3.65 miles : 11,722'). Travel moderates across alpine meadows with a great look at Mount Hope and a scenic tarn across the valley.

41,Willis Lake ,Aspen-Snowmass,10.3,9305,11742,2437,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," Willis Lake (11,742') is located 5.15 miles from Willis Gulch Trailhead in the San Isabel National Forest. It lies in a deep, tightly hemmed basin capped by Mount Hope (13,933'), Ervin Peak (13,531'), Mt Blaurock (13,616') and Rinker Peak (13,783') at the head of Willis Gulch. Trail Map | Photo Gallery  The route begins off Highway 82 and joins the Continental Divide Trail (CDT) before splitting off on the Big Willis Gulch Trail to the lake. Willis Lake can be overlooked for Hope Pass, a seminal point on the Leadville 100 racecourse accessed by the CDT.  It's no less compelling with long stretches of varied terrain and open space in the upper valley. The lake is uncommonly long and ringed by contrastingly steep rockslides, gentle slopes and muddy flats. Fishing is quite good with reports of cutthroat up to 18"". Anticipate rugged and overgrown sections on the last two miles, but nothing dissuasive. Note distance and max elevation figures here only reflect travel to the lake; the Big Willis Gulch Trail never actually drops to the lake and instead continues high up the valley wall to mine remains before fading out. A short scramble down is required to reach the shore: From the parking lot, cross the bridge over Lake Creek and head straight on a path through tall brush. Ignore social trails that branch off along the creek. Follow signs for Big and Little Willis Gulch #1471 that lead over beaver ponds to the Upper Twin Lake split (.37 miles : 9,435').

There are many cascades on this stretch though you'll have to work a bit to see the most kinetic ones. The trail climbs 385' from the bridge to the Little Willis - Big Willis Gulch split (1.8 miles : 10,278'). The Big Willis Gulch Trail breaks SW and moderates to stream crossings at 1.92 and 2.3 miles. It funnels up a tight gulch and climbs 340' in just .35 miles to a meadow (3.02 miles : 10,933') where the landscape opens to a long rockslide that takes a few minutes to cross (3.2 miles : 11,045'). Once over it begins rugged, shifting intervals through head-high willow that limit visibility. Watch your feet and trail closely on these obfuscated sections. Breaks in the willow pass through attractive meadows where you'll find cabin remains (3.95 miles : 11,350'). The trail clears treeline into a level expanse between a pond and the flank of Rinker Peak (4.45 miles : 11,590'). There's good camping terrain around the pond, though you'll have to punch through rocky willow mats to reach it. The trail rises up the west valley wall to great views over the lake basin and on to mining remains at the head of the valley. There's no designated route down to the lake and you'll have to improvise, but it's better to drop sooner than later because the further you go the more difficult it is to descend to Willis Lake (5.15 miles : 11,742').

42,Woody Creek Trail ,Aspen-Snowmass,18.4,8785,10443,1658,Strenuous,Yes," The Woody Creek Trail runs 9.2 miles through diverse forests across the Woody Creek and Hunter Creek drainages. This long and lightly used trail follows Woody Creek to its south fork headwaters, then rolls over a steep ridge and drops to the Hunter Creek side. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Woody Creek Trail is primarily used to access the Marcy and McNamara huts and few travel it's entire length, which arguably goes nowhere in particular. Visitors will find a great deal of solitude once past connections for these huts. While no one landmark stands out the trail features verdant forests, large meadows and great views across the Hunter-Fryingpan and Maroon Bells wilderness areas from high points along the way. There's good camping terrain along Woody Creek and wildlife is active in these fecund forests, especially during shoulder seasons. The trail is vague in many places but intuitively followed with cut logs and tree notches providing reliable guidance: The trail begins in a narrow corridor hemmed between talus-strewn walls and the creek. Remain alert for bears as you pass through overgrown brush and concentrations of currant, thimbleberry and raspberry. Sight may be limited here during peak summer growth. It crosses to the north side of Woody Creek (.4 miles) and passes the Wilderness boundary (.8 miles) on a rugged path that gradually clarifies to another crossing at 1.5 miles (9,425'). It rises to the Spruce Creek Trail split (1.55 miles : 9,505') and steepens away on a clearer path above the creek. Travel now moderates for long stretches in a notably verdant forest to a stream crossing that leads you up the south fork of Woody Creek (3.65 miles : 10,295'). Once over the trail loses clarity and turns sharply up the side of a boulder field; pay close attention on this vague, shifting segment. It crosses the creek again (3.95 miles - now just the smaller south fork) and regains clarity up to an expansive meadow (4.25 miles : 10,748'). This is a great place to see wildlife and fine turnaround point for day hikes. It skirts the meadow before turning back into thick timber and climbing steeply above it on a SE arc near the upper valley rim. The forest gradually thins and breaks at a meadow (5.55 miles : 11,395'); follow cairns straight across to find the trail on the far side. A good path continues on a challenging push through treeline to the divisive ridge between drainages (5.95 miles : 11,592'). It fades on the open ridge but cairns lead across and down the south (Hunter Creek) side where it clarifies in a reconstituted forest. The trail drops steeply to Deer Park (7.05 miles : 11,010') and undulates past this large meadow into dry, thinly-treed south-facing slope. Downhill travel eases with great views of the Elk Mountains to the Hunter Creek Trail junction at the Slab Park meadows (9.2 miles : 11,443'). The north (right) fork of the Hunter Creek Trail leads up to Bald Knob (11,092') and the McNamara Hut, and continues on a primitive path back to the Woody Creek Trail to form a loop.

Barr Lake is also home to coyote, badger, fox, rabbit, mule deer and white tail deer - one of few places in the Denver front range where these two commingle. Before settlement, Barr Lake was a deflation basin used by buffalo as a wallow. In the 1880s a dam was built on its north side, and water was diverted from the South Platte River to fill the newly formed Oasis Reservoir. After years of degradation, a massive flood in 1965 diluted pollution and gave the state a chance to restore its natural purity and habitat. Colorado purchased surrounding lands in 1975 and designated it a State Park. Several trails begin at the Barr Lake Nature Center: the Lake Perimeter Trail is the park's longest, an 8.9 mile multi-use loop around the lake and Wildlife Refuge. Its level, graded track is ideal for runners, families and winter recreation. The following description travels clockwise on the loop: Cross the bridge and turn left into the Wildlife Refuge. The Lake Perimeter Trail runs level around the lake's southeast shore through tall rows of cottonwood. Skip the first Fox Meadow Trail spur in favor of the second, a quick detour that leads to a wildlife viewing blind and spotting scope (1.05 miles : 5,128'). The Gazebo Boardwalk Trail spur (1.3 miles : 5,125') leads out to the lake's marshy shore with excellent views of a rookery (breeding ground) through a spotting scope. The main trail continues along the perimeter over an inlet stream, (2.25 miles : 5,126'), just past which is a bald eagle nesting and viewing area. The trail eases up the northwest shore and exits the Wildlife Refuge Boundary (4.5 miles : 5,106'). Here the woods and wetlands yield to a more suburban setting, and the trail follows a gritty train track from 4.75 miles - 5.15 miles. You'll reach the Barr Lake Dam in 5.9 miles (5,122') and have the option of walking along a berm (the Crest Trail) or beside it on the main path. See Worth Noting below for important information and restrictions on this section. The Barr Lake Dam forms the lake's northeast shore, stretching 1.35 miles from end to end. Once over (7.25 miles : 5,124'), it curls south and traces the shore past the boat ramp (7.8 miles) and Pioneer Trail spur (8.25 miles) back to the Nature Center to complete the loop (8.9 miles). Barr Lake State Park is located in Brighton, northeast of downtown Denver in Colorado's eastern plains. Trail Map | PhotosBarr Lake attracts over 350 migratory and resident avian species including white pelicans, great blue herons, cormorants, egrets, bald eagles, golden eagles and several types of hawks and falcons.Barr Lake is also home to coyote, badger, fox, rabbit, mule deer and white tail deer - one of few places in the Denver front range where these two commingle.Before settlement, Barr Lake was a deflation basin used by buffalo as a wallow. In the 1880s a dam was built on its north side, and water was diverted from the South Platte River to fill the newly formed Oasis Reservoir.After years of degradation, a massive flood in 1965 diluted pollution and gave the state a chance to restore its natural purity and habitat.

It's surrounded by short grass prairie and wetlands framed by the Boulder foothills. The Boulder Reservoir supplies 20% of Boulder's drinking water, 80-90% of which comes from the Boulder Feeder Canal and 10-20% from seasonal creeks and ditches. It typically fills by June and draws down to half its 13,270 acre-feet capacity by September. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The facility includes beach volleyball courts, boat rentals, a seasonal swim beach, restrooms, showers, horseshoe pits, 13 picnic tables and ramp access for boats. A series of paved, dirt and gravel road-trails form a contiguous 5.25 mile loop around the reservoir, deservedly one of Boulder's most popular running, cycling and bird watching destinations. Connections with the Eagle Trail and Coot Lake extend routing options through this biologically rich area. There are four access points to the Boulder Reservoir Loop - the following description begins at the 51st Street - West Portal Entrance and travels clockwise: The trail begins on a rolling, graded dirt road with one steep hill to the Eagle Trailhead lot (.8 miles : 5,258'). Sunflowers and thistle line this section, an area busy with prairie dogs, snakes, rabbit, coyote and raptors. The road continues northeast through wetlands (east) and open space (west) up to the 55th Street Trailhead (1.75 miles : 5,232'). Enter the lot and bear east on a narrow gravel path set just above the reservoir. Look for osprey, herons, egrets, ducks and pelicans in the nearby marsh. The trail steepens (2.1 miles) on a short switchback that levels over the main canal (2.35 miles : 5,245'). It widens on a dirt road with three access points to Coot Lake before curling west (2.9 miles : 5,228') to the reservoir's North Dam. Here it turns sharply south (3.25 miles : 5,220') along the flat dam wall, a fast-moving section with panoramas across the reservoir, foothills and back range. The road-trail turns southwest over the South Dam wall (3.85 miles : 5,222'), another fast section with comparable views. It merges with a hilly paved road on the reservoir's south shore (4.45 miles : 5,234') that rolls past the marina, boat house and swimming beach to complete the loop at the West Portal Entrance Station (5.25 miles).

The lollipop loop, 3 miles of which run along graded service roads that parallel North St. Vrain Creek, is ideal for trail running, winter activities, families, and anglers. The trail begins on a smooth service road, rising nominally along North St. Vrain Creek while skirting Longmont Reservoir, which at first glance appears little more than a wide, slow moving section of the creek. The grade increases to the Sleepy Lion Trail junction (.75 miles : 6,135'). The Sleepy Lion Trail turns south and rises sharply, weaving quickly through fir, ponderosa, cacti patches, and rocky outcrops. Views north of Button Rock Mt (8,417') are quite good as you climb. The trail exits the forest and levels into a large, rolling meadow (1.25 miles : 6,385'). This brief but attractive segment is a good place to find wildlife. Seasonal and occasionally seen are bighorn sheep that were re-introduced in the 1980s. Naturalists are studying this population's migration patterns, believed to use these lands as wintering and lambing grounds. The trail climbs steeply out of the meadow through a nondescript forest to the Button Rock Trail junction (1.75 miles : 6,625'). A little maneuvering yields terrific views across Ralph Price Reservoir and distant summits of Mt Meeker (13,911') and Longs Peak (14,259').

Trail Map | Photo Gallery  The trail is named for Ceran St. Vrain (1802 - 1870), a fur trader, politician and settler who established several trading posts and military forts along this creek and the South Platte River. 	This mild trail leads through pristine upper-montane forests, an inclusive ecological transition zone of lodgepole pine, spruce, fir and aspen. The riparian corridor it follows supports bigtooth maple, thin leaf alder, box elder and willow, which combine to produce brilliant autumn colors. 	Summer flowers thrive along the creek, notably columbine, wild rose and the prized Fairy Slipper Orchid. Visitors will enjoy good trail conditions, mild grades, easy stream access, desirable backcountry camping locations and excellent fishing: 	The trail begins over a long bridge with good up and down-stream views. Once over it turns north and undulates mildly up the creek's west bank with little net elevation loss to its unofficial terminus at the 801-252 Jeep road split (1.92 miles : 8,105'). 	The trail is generally clear and well-padded from layers of fallen pine needles, but negotiates a few high, narrow ledges on the first half mile that are tricky when iced over. Beyond that, it travels easily through intervals of mixed pine, narrow-walled passages, and broad stream shoulders. 	Though campsites are unmaintained, many are well-established and easy to find. 	No sign marks the trail's end, however it suddenly widens at the 801-252 4WD Jeep fork.

The Mesa Trail (2.75 miles), Bear Canyon Trail (1.85 miles) and Bear Peak West Ridge Trail (1.9 miles) form an ecologically varied route through ponderosa forests, meadows and high ridges.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	This route is longer but may be preferable to more direct and challenging ones through Gregory, Fern, and Shadow canyons:  From Chautauqua Park, head south on Blue Bell Road to the Mesa Trail (.6 miles : 6,010). Bear left and begin a steady climb through tall ponderosa stands to the Kohler Mesa Trail split (1.15 miles : 6,250'). The Mesa Trail levels across open contours with good views of the eastern plains. 	It dips and rises past the Skunk Canyon Trail junction to a steep, twisting descent on reinforced mud-stairs (1.85 miles). 	Once down the trail rises back through open slopes with good views of Bear Peak to the Mallory Cave Trail junction (2.05 miles : 6,207'). 	Travel quickens through undulating forest and drops to a service road (2.4 miles). Bear right on the service road for a steep climb to the Bear Canyon Trail split (2.75 miles : 6,262'). The Bear Canyon Trail is rugged in places but generally keeps a steady, moderate pace. 	The trail follows and frequently crosses Bear Canyon Creek, which can be tricky with heavy snow or heavy runoff. Note the emergence of aspen as you gain elevation. 	Though views are limited, Bear Canyon is not hemmed in quite like others in the area (Gregory Canyon, Fern Canyon and Shadow Canyon), generally affording better views. 	The trail crosses the creek (right) one last time (4.2 miles : 7,030'), and up a series of steep switchbacks on the canyon's north wall. 	Travel moderates in the upper canyon, now centrally positioned with terrific views back down the route you just traveled. It levels through a glade to the Bear Peak West Ridge Trail split (4.6 miles : 7,181'). 	Veer left here for the remaining 1.9 mile, 1280' push to Bear Peak. The West Ridge Trail is initially moderate, tracing a well-defined ridge that leads into the 2012 burn area (5.7 miles : 7,706'). 	Switchbacks steepen considerably past 6 miles, where you should anticipate many quick, rugged turns. Snow can make this final approach precarious and difficult to read. 	The trail emerges from timber in a scree field just below the summit (6.35 miles).

Trail Map | Photo Gallery Sediments deposited by the ebb and flow of inland oceans compressed this layer into sandstone, thrust upward 45 M years ago by the same tectonic forces that created our modern Rocky Mountains. Royal Arch is a fragment of the exposed Fountain Formation sculpted by water, wind and mechanical erosion into the 20' span we see today. The following describes the most direct route to Royal Arch, which begins at the Chautauqua Park Ranger Station and climbs Bluebell Road to access the Royal Arch Trail: Bluebell Road rises steadily over Chautauqua Park past the Mesa Trail junction (.6 miles : 6,005') and Bluebell Shelter to the Royal Arch Trail (.7 miles : 6,095'). The Royal Arch Trail narrows through mixed pine to a connection for Flatiron #2 and #3, and bends south up a steep, narrow gulch (.9 miles : 6,188'). Note apple, plum and maple in this diverse riparian corridor. The trail steepens away from the upper-gulch up to Sentinel Pass (1.35 miles : 6,768'), a rocky notch at the top of Bluebell Canyon. Enjoy close-up cross-sections of the Flatiron rocks from this point. It drops from Sentinel pass about 100' and resumes a strenuous, twisting climb over the steady trickle of Tangen Spring to the base of Royal Arch (1.6 miles : 6,915'). Walk under Royal Arch to a set of outcrops with sweeping views across the foothills, eastern plains and downtown Denver.

67,Fowler Trail ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,1.4,6087,6110,35,Easy,Yes," The walls of Eldorado Canyon State Park reveal its 1.7 billion year history in just a one mile span. Exposed granite at the canyon's west end was formed by seeping magma that cooled and solidified quartz, feldspar and biotite into igneous rock. Overlying this granite is 1.6 billion year old quartzite, which began as a thick layer of eroded sand that was buried, compressed into sedimentary rock and pushed closer to the earth's core.  Rising heat and pressure transformed this layer into metamorphic rock, a gray quartzite found at Supremacy Rock and Rattlesnake Gulch. 300 million years ago the Ancestral Rocky Mountain uplift, about 30 miles west, bore granite mountains that slowly eroded, depositing thick layers of sand and pebbles downstream.  These sediments were compressed into a layer of sandstone known as the Fountain Formation, famously exposed in Boulder's Flatirons and Golden's Red Rocks Amphitheater.  Hematite, or iron ore, gives these rocks a distinguished red hue. Most of Eldorado Canyon's highest cliff walls are part of this formation. 280 million years ago sand blew west from eastern deserts, settling as dunes over the Fountain Formation and compressed into sedimentary rock over the next 40 million years.  This newest layer, known as the Lyons Formation, is visible at the mouth of Eldorado Canyon.  65 million years ago a second Rocky Mountain uplift forced horizontal layers of the Fountain and Lyons formations upward, exposed today by the erosive force of South Boulder Creek.  These tilted layers usher water 8,000' underground, where it's forced back to the surface as an artesian spring. The Fowler Trail - self guided nature walk traces a short section of South Boulder Creek east through the canyon with revealing perspective on the towering cliffs above.  Free interpretive brochures at the Visitor Center explain the canyon's complex geology, rich biology and storied human history.  The Fowler Trail is ideal for curious minds and families of any age and skill level. The Fowler Trail begins at the Rattlesnake Gulch Trailhead and heads east on level track past the Rattlesnake Gulch Trail split.  12 marked points along the way correlate with an educational brochure.  The trail continues east and wraps just south of the canyon mouth to the Eldorado Canyon State Park boundary (.7 miles : 6,110').  Retrace your steps back, or continue on the Fowler Trail 1.3 miles to its eastern terminus at the Eldorado Mountain Trailhead. Those seeking an even longer adventure can improvise routes via connections with the Goshawk Ridge and North Spring Brook trails, .95 miles and 1.45 miles from the Rattlesnake Gulch Trailhead, respectively.

Those seeking a longer trip may continue on the Rattlesnake Loop Trail, an additional 1.4 miles that includes a short spur to the Continental Divide Overlook: 	Follow signs west to The Rattlesnake Gulch Loop - Continental Divide Overlook spur, which comes rather abruptly (1.5 miles : 6,810'); take note of this sparingly marked point and continue a few steps further to the Continental Divide Overlook (1.55 miles : 6,815'). 	The promise of a grand overlook is perhaps over-stated, nevertheless a quiet place with rangy views over the canyon and distant peaks. Retrace your steps back to the Rattlesnake Gulch Loop Trail and veer right. 	Here the trail bends back east and climbs up the south wall.

The northern, south-facing section was taken by fire in 2000, leaving a charred, barren landscape in its wake. 	Despite compromised aesthetics, fire is crucial to the natural lifecycle and healthy maintenance of a pine forest ecosystem. Periodic fire thins under-stories and deadfall, preventing the long term buildup of fuel that can lead to more permanently devastating events. It also replenishes soil and clears space for the reclamation of diverse native plant species on which local wildlife depend. Ponderosa Pine, protected by a resinous fire-resistant bark, need fire to pry open their cones to release seeds and initiate reproduction. In Walker Ranch, grasses and wildflowers have reemerged on these hillsides and recovery is well under way. 	The following description begins at the Crescent Meadows Trailhead (southern terminus): 	The South Boulder Creek Trail drops steeply on winding switchbacks through dense pine forest to South Boulder Creek (1.3 miles : 6,740').

71,Fowler Trail ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,4.0,5885,6087,202,Easy,Yes," The Fowler Trail winds through open space at the mouth of Eldorado Canyon and ends at the Rattlesnake Gulch Trailhead within Eldorado Canyon State Park. The final .7 miles feature 12 points of biological and geological interest explained by free brochures available at the Eldorado Canyon Visitor Center.  This short, mild trail runs mostly over groomed service roads, ideal terrain for young families, runners and cross-country skiers.  Connections with the Spring Brook Trail North, Goshawk Ridge Trail and Rattlesnake Gulch Trail provide additional routing options for longer treks through Open Space lands and the Eldorado Canyon interior. The Fowler Trail begins on a wide service road, rising gently and winding deliberately along spacious contours of the outer-canyon.  The steady climb soon yields picturesque views across the canyon mouth and northern foothills.  You'll pass the Spring Brook North Trail split (.55 miles : 6,075') and continue through a blasted notch in the road (.75 miles) to the Goshawk Ridge Trail split (1.05 miles : 6,105').   Here the Fowler Trail levels considerably through the Eldorado Canyon State Park boundary  (1.3 miles : 6,110') and narrows on rocky single track.  It bends west and enters the canyon along the south wall.  The trail glides easily above a short piece of South Boulder Creek to its terminus at the Rattlesnake Gulch Trailhead (2.0 miles : 6,087'). The striking walls above reveal the canyon's 1.7 billion year history in a very short space. Exposed granite at the canyon's west end was formed by seeping magma that cooled and solidified quartz, feldspar and biotite into igneous rock. Over this granite is 1.6 billion year old quartzite, which began as a thick layer of eroded sand that was buried, compressed into sedimentary rock and pushed closer to the earth's core. Rising heat and pressure transformed this layer into metamorphic rock. 300 million years ago the Ancestral Rocky Mountain uplift bore mountains of granite that slowly eroded, depositing thick layers of sand and pebbles downstream. These sediments were compressed into a layer of sandstone known as the Fountain Formation, famously exposed in Boulder's Flatirons and Golden's Red Rocks Amphitheater. Hematite, or iron ore, gives these rocks a distinguished red hue. Most of Eldorado Canyon's highest cliff walls are part of this formation.  280 million years ago sand blew west from eastern deserts, settling as dunes over the Fountain Formation and compressed into sedimentary rock over the next 40 million years. This newest layer, known as the Lyons Formation, is visible at the mouth of Eldorado Canyon. 65 million years ago a second Rocky Mountain uplift forced horizontal layers of the Fountain and Lyons formations upward, exposed today by the erosive force of South Boulder Creek. These tilted layers usher water 8,000' underground, where it's forced back to the surface as an artesian spring in the historical town of Eldorado Springs.

75,Elk Meadow Loop ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,3.5,7628,8097,469,Easy-Moderate,Yes," Elk Meadow Park spans an aggregate of historic homestead parcels that were first established in the late 1850s, and changed hands several times over the decades before acquisition by Jefferson County Open Space in 1975. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Elk Meadow Park covers 1140 acres of expansive meadows, ponderosa parks and montane forests at the foot of Bergen Peak. A well-maintained multiuse trail system offers routes of varying distance and difficulty through the meadows, foothills and up to the summit (9,708'). Prior to European settlement the central Colorado foothills were a mosaic of open meadows and pinyon - ponderosa forests that supported large elk herds. The grassland - ponderosa forest ecosystem is naturally maintained by low-intensity fires every 5-15 years that keep tree and shrub densities in check. Mature ponderosa bark can withstand such fires, while their cones need this heat to open and release seeds. Fire also rejuvenates soil and clears space for grazing and seasonal migrations. Homesteading in the late 1800s ushered in decades of fire suppression, producing forests of unnatural densities susceptible to widespread, high-intensity fires from which they cannot always recover. It's thought that only a few dozen trees once naturally occupied an acre of land, whereas today they can exceed thousands. Through careful management, selective cutting and prescribed burns, Elk Meadow Park has successfully restored this ecosystem to a natural state. Elk now roam here year round, joined by deer, badger, bear and mountain lion. The Sleepy S, Painters Pause, Founders, Meadow View and Elk Ridge trails form an easy 3.5 mile loop around the heart of the meadows. Hikers, runners and cyclists will enjoy mild grades, year-round utility and a great chance to see elk in their natural habitat. The following description travels counter-clockwise on the Elk Meadow Loop: From the trailhead on Lewis Ridge Road, veer right off the Sleepy S Trail to pick up the Painters Pause Trail. Painters Pause runs north to the Founders Trail (.45 miles : 7,655'), where you can divert a few steps to see an historical cabin. The Founders Trail edges northwest across the meadow and bands of ponderosa to the Meadow View Trail (1.05 miles : 7,825').  The Meadow Trail turns south and undulates through intervals of mixed pine, aspen and open space between the meadow and lower slopes of Bergen Peak.

The Sleepy S Trail returns to the trailhead on Lewis Ridge Road to complete the loop (3.55 miles : 7,628'). Elk Meadow Park spans an aggregate of historic homestead parcels that were first established in the late 1850s, and changed hands several times over the decades before acquisition by Jefferson County Open Space in 1975.Trail Map | Photo GalleryElk Meadow Park covers 1140 acres of expansive meadows, ponderosa parks and montane forests at the foot of Bergen Peak. A well-maintained multiuse trail system offers routes of varying distance and difficulty through the meadows, foothills and up to the summit (9,708').Prior to European settlement the central Colorado foothills were a mosaic of open meadows and pinyon - ponderosa forests that supported large elk herds.The grassland - ponderosa forest ecosystem is naturally maintained by low-intensity fires every 5-15 years that keep tree and shrub densities in check. Mature ponderosa bark can withstand such fires, while their cones need this heat to open and release seeds. Fire also rejuvenates soil and clears space for grazing and seasonal migrations.Homesteading in the late 1800s ushered in decades of fire suppression, producing forests of unnatural densities susceptible to widespread, high-intensity fires from which they cannot always recover.It's thought that only a few dozen trees once naturally occupied an acre of land, whereas today they can exceed thousands.Through careful management, selective cutting and prescribed burns, Elk Meadow Park has successfully restored this ecosystem to a natural state. Elk now roam here year round, joined by deer, badger, bear and mountain lion.The Sleepy S, Painters Pause, Founders, Meadow View and Elk Ridge trails form an easy 3.5 mile loop around the heart of the meadows. Hikers, runners and cyclists will enjoy mild grades, year-round utility and a great chance to see elk in their natural habitat.The following description travels counter-clockwise on the Elk Meadow Loop:From the trailhead on Lewis Ridge Road, veer right off the Sleepy S Trail to pick up the Painters Pause Trail.

Apple trees in lower Gregory Canyon were likely planted by Ernest Greenman, who's credited with planting hundreds of apple trees throughout the Boulder foothill canyons.",39.997416666667,-105.292866666667,38.516666666666666

The following description summits both peaks, and omits re-summiting Green Mountain on the return: 	The Gregory Canyon Trail rises steadily to a stream crossing (.5 miles : 6,162'), then climbs steeply on a twisting, rocky path to milder switchbacks in the upper canyon (1.0 miles : 6,670'). 	The 2013 floods stripped away much of the corridor's vegetation, revealing portions of stream that were typically veiled. Look for bears foraging apple and plum trees throughout the canyon. 	The trail gradually levels and curls SW, following a nominally re-routed path beside a newly carved gorge to the historic Greenman Lodge at the Ranger Trail split (1.48 miles : 6,754'). 	The Ranger Trail moderates through tall, mixed pine to the E.M. Greenman Trail split (1.7 miles : 6,965'), past which it steepens on a winding, business-like climb. 	The Ranger Trail crests at the Green-Bear Trail - Green Mt West Ridge Trail split along a narrow ridge below the summit (2.55 miles : 7,860'). Turn left toward Green Mountain. 	The summit access trail scrambles over rock and root to Green Mountain (2.7 miles : 8,144'). The summit is small but topped by a rock-spire and peak-finder that illustrates a 100-mile span. 	From Green Mountain, head back down to the Green-Bear Trail (2.85 miles) and turn south downhill. Portions of this descent are steep but the majority is moderate and smooth, an ideal track for runners. A few thinly treed meadows along the way provide good habitat and viewing lanes for wildlife. 	The Green-Bear Trail drops 680' in 1.75 miles down the south flank of Green Mountain to the Bear Canyon Trail - Bear Peak West Ridge Trail split  in the saddle between the summits (4.65 miles : 7,181'). Turn up the West Ridge Trail for the 1.9 mile, 1280' push to Bear Peak. 	The West Ridge Trail is initially moderate, tracing a well-defined ridge with emerging views of Bear Canyon, South Boulder Peak and Walker Ranch. 	Fire scars are visible from a distance, but you'll abruptly enter the burn area at 5.8 miles (7,706'). Despite a ghostly appearance the area is well on its way to recovery. Though it will be many years before healthy pine return, grasses, flowers and ground cover have already rooted. 	Switchbacks steepen considerably at the base of Bear Peak's conical summit (6.0 miles : 7,805'). Anticipate quick turns up rugged terrain on this final approach; snow and ice can make this strenuous section precarious and difficult to read. 	The trail emerges from timber in a scree field that wraps (right) to the Shadow Canyon Trail split (6.48 miles : 8,395'), just below the summit on the west face. Here several intuitive scramble routes lead up to Bear Peak (6.55 miles : 8,461'). 	The most popular route curls back NE to the Fern Canyon Trail split, then up. No matter how you tackle it these final yards are steep, challenging and exposed. 	The pointed, wind-swept summit is little more than a jagged boulder pile, however cautious maneuvering leads to safe viewing areas across the plains, foothills, and Rocky Mountains.

87,Greyrock Trail ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,7.15,5630,7513,1883,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes,"  Greyrock Mountain (7,513') stands prominently over the north rim of Poudre Canyon, 25 minutes from downtown Fort Collins, Colorado. The Grey Rock Trail and Grey Rock Meadows Trail form a loop around the conical formation, with a short but challenging spur that leads to the summit.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The following description travels counter-clockwise on the loop, with an excursion to the summit: 	From the Greyrock Mountain Trailhead (5,630'), cross the Cache la Poudre River and head west through dense underbrush and ponderosa pine. 	Bear right at the Grey Rock Meadows Trail - Greyrock Trail split to begin the loop (.65 miles : 5,920'). The Greyrock Trail bends due north and steepens through a tight canyon, gaining nearly 1,000' in just a mile. Deadfall and debris pushed down the canyon by flash floods line the way. 	The trail eases on the canyon rim with panoramic views of Poudre Canyon, Rocky Mountain National Park, and the Comanche Peak Wilderness Area (1.7 miles : 6,837'). 	It continues .4 miles north to a revealing look at Greyrock Mountain from the Greyrock Meadows - Summit Trail junction (2.1 miles : 6,973'). 	The Summit Trail meanders through a striking meadow before taking an aggressive route to the summit. This stretch can be difficult to both hike and follow, with uneven footing and some minor scrambling required to reach the top. Rock cairns and hiker signs offer guidance as the trail rounds the southeast flank of Greyrock Mountain on the final approach.  Greyrock Mountain (2.65 miles : 7,513') - known as The Rock to locals - is quite unique. A small lake rests between two points on the summit itself, forming an oasis of ecological diversity in an area one might expect to be barren. 	Retrace your steps down the Greyrock Summit Trail to the Greyrock Meadows Trail split (3.3 miles : 6,973'). Keep straight on the Greyrock Meadows Trail to continue the loop. 	The Greyrock Meadows Trail drops on a southwest heading through an area scarred by the Picnic Rock Fire in April 2004. It descends 241' from the Summit Trail split into the stunning open space of Greyrock Meadows (3.65 miles : 6,732'). 	The trail heads south through Greyrock Meadows with excellent views to the west, and back north of Greyrock Mountain. Look for signs of deer, coyote, fox, skunk, bear, and mountain lion in this richly appointed space. 	The trail leaves the meadows and switchbacks east on a steady climb through a mixed pine, fir, and spruce forest (4.5 miles : 6,814'). Views of Greyrock Mountain are quite good on this easterly tack. After a mile of steady climbing, the Greyrock Meadows Trail crests and opens up to the fully exposed backside of the loop (5.5 miles : 7,088'). 	Here the trail begins its final descent, dropping over 1000' in just one mile. The descent provides excellent views to the west of Hewlett Gulch, Poudre Canyon, and surrounding high peaks. 	The trail returns to the Greyrock Trail - Greyrock Meadows Trail split (6.5 miles : 5,920), where you'll veer onto the Greyrock Trail for .65 miles back to the trailhead (7.15 miles : 5,630').

The Bitterbrush Trail and Nelson Loop Trail form a 9.4 mile lollipop loop through rolling hills and elevated meadows in the heart of Hall Ranch. 	Trails at Hall Ranch can be muddy, especially after heavy rain and during the spring thaw. Trail conditions are posted at the trailhead. BIkers are advised to stay off trails when muddy to expedite recovery and reduce rutting:  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  The Bitterbrush Trail rolls gently through open grassland for .7 miles, then climbs steeply up rugged, tightly-wound switchbacks. Hikers and runners should make room for cyclists on these quick turns. 	The trail levels on a high ridge overlooking an expansive meadow (2.0 miles : 6,151'). This area supports a large prairie dog village, a good place to see coyote, badger, rattlesnakes and raptors. 	The Bitterbrush drops sharply to the Antelope Trail split (2.2 miles: 6,089'), and moderates on a rolling course for 1.35 miles to the Nelson Loop Trail junction (3.55 miles: 6,407'). 	This attractive 2.3 mile loop moves easily through intervals of high open space, thick pine forest and rocky outcrops. Deer are ubiquitous, while rabbit, coyote and fox are also fairly common. 	The Nelson Loop gains only 360' in total elevation; travel clockwise for a quicker route to its apex, or counter-clockwise on a more leisurely grade. Both directions offer panoramas across the upper meadows toward Mt Meeker and Longs Peak. 	Approximately half-way around, the Nelson Loop connects with the Nighthawk Trail at its highest point (6,703'). The Nighthawk Trail offers a compelling, bike-free alternative route back to the parking lot.  About Hall Ranch 	This part of Colorado once marked the western shoreline of a massive inland sea that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Hudson Bay. The inland sea surged and retreated periodically, depositing and compressing sedimentary layers many times over the millennia. Tectonic forces related to the Rocky Mountain uplift rippled east, forcing rock layers to bulge along the plains and exposing them to various forms of erosion. 	260 million years ago windblown particles from coastal dunes added to this complex sedimentary mix, creating a hard quartz sandstone called the Lyons Formation. The Lyons Formation has a distinct salmon-red hue for which the iconic mesas of Hall Ranch are known. 	Hall Ranch ranges from 5,440' - 6,820' and supports a variety of distinct ecosystems: grasslands, shrublands, ponderosa-pinyon woodlands, Douglass fir forests, riparian corridors and canyons. 	Bluestem, New Mexico feathergrass, and western wheatgrass fill meadows, while durable shrubs such as prickly pear cactus, wax current, yucca, and bitterbrush occupy drier, rockier soil beds. Ponderosa, pinyon, and juniper dot the hillsides, naturally spaced apart to maintain a healthy fire cycle. Fir and lodgepole can be found in denser concentrations at higher elevations on the higher, west side of Hall Ranch. 	These varied ecosystems overlap in a relatively small space, attracting a wide range of wildlife that includes rattlesnakes, prairie dog, skunk, badger, fox, coyote, turkey, deer, elk, bear, and mountain lion. Bighorn sheep are known to follow winter migration routes through the high, rugged cliffs in the northwest corner of Hall Ranch. Even a short hike through Hall Ranch will expose you to many of these ecotones and inhabitants. 	Hall Ranch was first homesteaded by Richard Clark in 1890, and since more than 20 families have lived in the area prospecting, farming, or quarrying sandstone. The Nelson family purchased this land in 1922, and later sold to Hallyn and June Hall in the 1940s.

Trail Map | Photo Gallery  The Nighthawk Trail offers a bike-free route with connections to the Nelson Loop and Button Rock Trail. Runners may also prefer the Nighthawk's consistent terrain and steady pace: 	The Nighthawk Trail rolls gently through open grassland for .85 miles, crests and drops into a shallow gully (1.1 miles : 5,555'). Here it begins a 3.6 mile, 1148' climb on winding, moderately steep (but well-kept) switchbacks. 	The trail bends NW and rises quickly through open rolling hills and over deep canyons. Spring travelers will enjoy wavy green grasses, flowers and cacti blooms. Deer are very common along this stretch. 	The trail occasionally abuts service roads, but these are not for public use and should not be taken. At 3.65 miles the trail does merge momentarily with a service road, but quickly departs (left) on a clearly marked path into a shallow gully that holds a water tank for horses. 	The trail climbs above the tank and threads dense pine on the edge of a large, sloping meadow. It's briefly obscured once more on a hairpin turn around the remains of an old stone wall (4.1 miles : 6,702'), but easy to reclaim once around it. 	The trail crests and moderates (4.4 miles) with excellent views of Mt Meeker, Longs Peak, and the Twin Sisters. A few steps off-trail leads to wider views of the Continental Divide, and down a wide valley ideal for seeing wildlife. 	The final segment weaves through sparse forest and rocky outcrops into a vast, lofty meadow at the Button Rock Trail split (4.5 miles : 6,703'), and its terminus at the Nelson Loop Trail (4.7 miles : 6,703'). 	Those seeking a longer hike may add the 2.3 mile Nelson Loop.

Hikers, runners and mountain bikers will enjoy mild grades, smooth track, miles of open space and a variety of wildlife: The trail begins on smooth single track through a wavy mix of feathergrass, little bluestem and big bluestem. It rises steadily on a winding course through a spacious valley dotted with yucca, cacti, pinyon and juniper.  Heavily vegetated gulches carve through the area, riparian corridors that attract wildlife and serve as natural thoroughfares. Views of Hall Ranch and its Lyon Formation sandstone improve as you climb. The trail reaches a picnic area in the mid-valley where juniper crowds the path (1.95 miles : 5,727').  A meandering path leads into the upper valley, where the landscape opens considerably (2.7 miles : 5,920').  Look for deer, elk, coyote, fox, and turkey in this rolling expanse. The trail edges to the west side of the valley and threads dense timber on a more rugged track (3.5 miles : 6,052').  You'll reach a Trail Narrows sign at 4.2 miles (6,170'), but see little difference beyond this point.  The Picture Rock Trail moves steadily to its connection with the Wild Turkey Trail (5.2 miles : 6,392'), a newly created loop that continues through Heil Ranch proper. Complete the 2.9 Wild Turkey Loop Trail for a 13.3 mile outing, or use it to connect with the Wapiti Loop Trail for additional route and distance options. Heil Valley Ranch is home to over 50 mammal species including deer, elk, bobcat, bear and mountain lion.Rattlesnakes are drawn to prairie dog villages and sunny outcrops, and serve as a good reminder to remain on designated trails at all times. Golden eagles and prairie falcons nest on sandstone cliffs over these valleys, while contiguous wooded areas are favored by northern goshawk and Cooper's hawk.  Turkey are abundant at Heil Ranch, and frequently seen throughout the year. ",40.211366666667,-105.272516666667,60.833333333333336

Horsetooth Mountain Open Space Park supports 29 miles of multipurpose trails through native grasslands, ponderosa woodlands and montane forests.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  Horsetooth Rock (7,256') caps Horsetooth Mountain, the park's tallest and most recognizable feature. According to Native American legend, Horsetooth Rock is the remains of the heart of an evil giant, slain and cut in two by Chief Maununmoku.  European settlers believed the rock bore a greater resemblance to a horse tooth, hence the modern name. Numerous routes lead to the summit; the most direct route begins at the Horsetooth Mountain Open Space Trailhead and follows the Horsetooth Rock Trail: 	The Horsetooth Rock Trail rises through open grasslands dotted with yucca, cacti, and cattail to the Horsetooth Falls Trail connection (.32 miles : 5,923'). It continues steadily up a well defined path to the first of four connections and brief merges with the multi-use South Ridge Trail (.55 miles : 6,095'). Remain on the Horsetooth Trail in each instance. 	The trail winds north-northwest into a mixed pine forest that thickens as you progress. Look for signs of deer, fox, coyote, skunk, bobcat, mountain lion, and bear along the way. Large outcrops flank much of the trail, which are good places to find a sunning rattlesnake. Frequent breaks in the timber provide views over the lower foothills, Horsetooth Reservoir and eastern plains. 	The trail reaches a 4th and unmarked merge with the South Ridge Trail; bear right to remain on track (2.0 miles : 6,875'). Note that a side spur veers left to excellent views of the Horsetooth. 	A short distance ahead is the Wathen Trail connection (2.1 miles : 6,888'), beyond which the trail grows rugged and periodically ill-defined over rock slabs. Remain vigilant to a set of rock-notch steps just below the Audra Culver Trail split (2.25 miles : 6,982'). 	The trail keeps a north-northwest heading past an informational sign before curling steeply to a gap on the north side of the Horsetooth. Here you'll begin a short but rugged scramble (back south) to the top of Horsetooth Rock and Horsetooth Mountain summit (2.5 miles : 7,256'). 	The summit is long and thin with unabated panoramas across the eastern plains, lower foothills, reservoir, and Rocky Mountains. Notable from these heights are hogbacks, or homoclinal ridges, that run uniformly north-south between the plains and foothills. 	These uplifted and tilted formations are typically comprised of two compressed sedimentary layers that eroded at different rates. As the softer layer erodes, its slopes steepen and the harder layer emerges along it edges. These rounded formations with a jagged rock outline resemble the knobby spine of a hog.

Frequent breaks in the timber provide views over the lower foothills, Horsetooth Reservoir and eastern plains.	The trail reaches a 4th and unmarked merge with the South Ridge Trail; bear right to remain on track (2.0 miles : 6,875'). Note that a side spur veers left to excellent views of the Horsetooth.	A short distance ahead is the Wathen Trail connection (2.1 miles : 6,888'), beyond which the trail grows rugged and periodically ill-defined over rock slabs. Remain vigilant to a set of rock-notch steps just below the Audra Culver Trail split (2.25 miles : 6,982').	The trail keeps a north-northwest heading past an informational sign before curling steeply to a gap on the north side of the Horsetooth. Here you'll begin a short but rugged scramble (back south) to the top of Horsetooth Rock and Horsetooth Mountain summit (2.5 miles : 7,256').	The summit is long and thin with unabated panoramas across the eastern plains, lower foothills, reservoir, and Rocky Mountains. Notable from these heights are hogbacks, or homoclinal ridges, that run uniformly north-south between the plains and foothills.	These uplifted and tilted formations are typically comprised of two compressed sedimentary layers that eroded at different rates. As the softer layer erodes, its slopes steepen and the harder layer emerges along it edges. These rounded formations with a jagged rock outline resemble the knobby spine of a hog.",40.524066666667,-105.181083333333,79.66666666666667
98,Lion Gulch Trail to Homestead Meadows ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,6.1,7370,8447,1077,Moderate,Yes," 	The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged western expansion by opening America's land to agricultural settlement. To qualify, a person had to be a US citizen (or express the intent to become one), older than 21 (or head of a household) and possess less than 160 acres of their own land.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	To acquire the property title one had to build a house within 5 years, occupy the land for at least 6 months of the year, make income related to the property and cultivate a portion of the land. After 6 months one could buy the land for $1.25 an acre, or $15 outright after 5 years. Homesteaders could acquire up to 320 acres of land under the Act, a program that ended in 1976.  Homestead Meadows, listed on the National Registry of Historic Places, contains the remains of over a dozen cabins from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It's easy to see why this area attracted homesteaders, with miles of rolling meadows well-suited for ranching, hunting and building. 	Visitors will enjoy a moderate hike on the Lion Gulch Trail to an up-close look at these well-preserved historic sites: 	The trail drops from the parking lot into a gulch, over a creek and rises steadily up the far side. It crosses back over (.35 miles) and merges with the equestrian trail (.45 miles : 7,435'), gradually bending northwest (.6 miles) along the upper-gulch. 	The trail crosses a third bridge (1.0 miles : 7,538') and intensifies on a twisting, undulating course in a busy forest. Pinyon, lodgepole and ponderosa give way to aspen, fir and spruce on the rapid climb. 	Grades moderate beside a small creek (1.9 miles : 8,137') as the forest opens on level double track (2.5 miles : 8,345') to the Lion's Paw Trail - Pierson Park split (2.95 miles : 8,424'). Continue straight to the welcome sign for Homestead Meadows (3.05 miles : 8,447') and access to the Walker, Griffith, Irvin and Brown homestead sites (an additional .25, .5, 1.5 and 2.0 miles, respectively). 	The main trail continues through an aspen-ringed meadow and skirts the Walker Homestead, with various social trails leading to its scattered remains. It re-enters a sparse forest and rises modestly to the next three sites. 	Be mindful of private property boundaries and stay on designated trails as you move deeper into the historic district. Those not pressing on may consider minimizing their profile around the meadows' edge and looking for wildlife such as deer, elk, turkey and fox. 	The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged western expansion by opening America's land to agricultural settlement.

Located just 2 miles north of Nederland, Colorado, scenic Mud Lake is surrounded by 233 acres of pristine wilderness that provide year-round recreation for hikers, mountain bikers and horseback riders.  The double loop trail described here is made possible by simply combining the Tungsten Loop Trail with the Kinneckinneck Loop Trail.  From the NW corner of the Mud Lake Parking lot (next to the restrooms), the trail sets out flat through dense coniferous forest typical of the Nederland area. After .1 miles you'll encounter the first trail split. Turn left towards the Tungsten Loop.  50' away, the Tungsten Loop Trail begins and Mud Lake is soon visible. The trail skirts the east shore of Mud Lake and, despite easy access to the lake itself, fishing, swimming or boating are NOT allowed.  These regulations are strictly enforced.At .6 miles the trail reaches the Tungsten Loop - Kinneckinneck Loop split (8,484').  Bear left towards the Kinneckinneck Loop Trail - in about 100', the Kinneckinneck Loop Trail begins. The loop rises gently amid healthy stands of Aspen and Ponderosa Pine.  At 1.3 miles, the Kinneckinneck Loop crests at 8,594' and yields the best (and only) views of the entire trail. Large peaks and glaciers are visible to the north and west as you begin downward to complete the Kinneckinneck Loop.  At 1.7 miles you will complete the Kinneckinneck loop and take the clearly marked 100' connector trail back to the Tungsten Loop. Head left to complete the last section of the Tungsten Loop.

The trail remains open, however, the cave itself is not open to the public. The closure stems from an epidemic of white-nosed syndrome, a fungal disease that has destroyed bat populations across the country.   	The U.S. Forest Service closed all caves on National Grassland and Forest properties across several states in an attempt to limit the potential for spread in the Western region. Because the disease is primarily found in human-accessible recreational caves, people are thought to be the main cause of spreading. 	------------------------------------------------ 	  	The Mallory Cave Trail in Boulder's front range is a short but steep hike to a large cave first discovered, but not recorded, by loggers cutting down trees on Dinosaur Mountain. The cave was then re-discovered in the summer of 1932 by a young University of Colorado Student named E.C. Mallory. 	  	Begin by heading out on the Walter Orr Roberts Trail, an interpretative trail just west of the NCAR parking lot. Head west on this trail for about .6 miles before hitting the Mesa Trail. Turn hard left on to the Mesa Trail and then quickly head up the clearly marked trail to Mallory Cave. 	  	Upon turning onto the trail to Mallory Cave, the hike will get quite steep. The narrow trail leads you up Dinosaur Mountain through towering sandstone formations with outstanding views of Boulder and the plains back to the east. 	  	As you near the end of the hike, keep an eye out for a red rock staircase which leads straight up to the final staging area before climbing to the cave itself. There will be signs directing you to the cave so be sure to pay attention. 	  	The final 50-75 feet of the climb are difficult. While not a technical climb, the route is steep, rocky and slick. Be very careful in wet or cold weather, as the final ascent to the cave can be very dangerous. 	  	After the final ascent to the cave, enjoy spectacular views of NCAR, Boulder and the eastern plains. While the cave itself may appear a bit ""used"", people continue to marvel at its history as one of Boulder's oldest recorded front range hikes.  Note: Mallory Cave is closed until further notice.

Here the Foothills Trail bends south (left) towards Wonderland Lake, and the right fork trail continues north for several miles along the foothills. 	The Hogback Loop's left fork takes a steep, direct approach to the loop's highest point, while the right fork runs a longer, more gradual course. With better views and lighting in mind, the following describes clockwise travel on the Hogback Loop Trail: 	From the split, steep grades continue up rudimentary stairs (.9 miles) that spill into a saddle between two hogbacks (1.15 miles : 6,192'). Rocky outcrops and pine trees dot the saddle, a pretty space with good perspective on this uniquely textured landscape. After a brief reprieve a short, final push leads to the top of a boulder-strewn hogback (1.35 miles : 6,393). Exercise caution when scrambling about, as rattlesnakes are common to the area. 	The trail crests atop the hogback and drops quickly on its northern ridge to milder grades that run perpendicular across a yawning eastern slope. You'll enjoy sensational views of the eastern plains, Boulder Reservoir and Chautauqua Park area on this diverting stretch. Travel eases upon completing the loop (2.35 miles), and continues downhill .6 miles back to the trailhead. 	This short trail climbs and circles the east face of a Hogback, a sharply rounded ridge with steep sloping sides where the eastern plains meet Colorado's Front Range.

Here the Foothills Trail bends south (left) towards Wonderland Lake, and the right fork trail continues north for several miles along the foothills. 	The Hogback Loop's left fork takes a steep, direct approach to the loop's highest point, while the right fork runs a longer, more gradual course. With better views and lighting in mind, the following describes clockwise travel on the Hogback Loop Trail: 	From the split, steep grades continue up rudimentary stairs (.9 miles) that spill into a saddle between two hogbacks (1.15 miles : 6,192'). Rocky outcrops and pine trees dot the saddle, a pretty space with good perspective on this uniquely textured landscape. After a brief reprieve a short, final push leads to the top of a boulder-strewn hogback (1.35 miles : 6,393). Exercise caution when scrambling about, as rattlesnakes are common to the area. 	The trail crests atop the hogback and drops quickly on its northern ridge to milder grades that run perpendicular across a yawning eastern slope. You'll enjoy sensational views of the eastern plains, Boulder Reservoir and Chautauqua Park area on this diverting stretch. Travel eases upon completing the loop (2.35 miles), and continues downhill .6 miles back to the trailhead.",40.0704333333333,-105.2827,43.7
106,North Table ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,3.2,6030,6030,478,Easy-Moderate,Yes," North Table Mountain Park is located on the east side of Highway 93 in Golden, Colorado. The Park encompasses 2,000 acres of a large mesa complex that rises 500' from the open plains to a sprawling mixed grass prairie on top. The mesa's core was formed by lava flows that emanated from the Ralston Dike two miles away. Sedimentary deposits that once covered this hardened lava have eroded, resulting in the steep-sided formation we see today. Table Mountain's grasslands support a variety of wildlife including deer, coyote, rabbit, prairie dog, and rattlesnake, while golden eagles, hawks, and falcons nest in vertical cliffs along the mesa's rim. Spring-fed ponds draw waterfowl, and serve as headwaters for riparian corridors that underpin the mountain's ecosystem. A network of multi-use trails circle Table Mountain and connect through its elevated grasslands.  The North Table Trail, Tilting Mesa Trail, and Mesa Top Trail form a short loop from base to top, exposing visitors to the area's distinct ecological and geological features. The following description begins on the south side of the parking lot and travels counter-clockwise on the North Table Loop Trail: The North Table Loop Trail climbs steeply on wide rough pour to the mesa top and Tilting Mesa Trail split (.6 miles : 6,478').  Examine folds in the upper cliff walls and look for raptors before veering left on the Tilting Mesa Trail, which ventures east along the mesa top. The Tilting Mesa levels through rolling short grass prairie dotted with cacti, yucca, cattail, yarrow, and a variety of wildflowers.  It wraps north around a small pond (1.1 miles : 6,445'), one of several on Table Mountain that attract waterfowl and song birds. Bypass a spur for the Rim Rock Trail (1.55 miles) before seamlessly merging onto the Mesa Top Trail (1.7 miles : 6,485'). The Mesa Top Trail skirts the edge of a much larger pond and edges toward another near a second Rim Rock Trail access spur (1.7 miles : 6,485').  Here it crests and drops back a second connection with the North Table Loop Trail (2.3 miles : 6,085').  The North Table Loop Trail curls southwest on a moderately steep grade down to the mesa's base, where it levels through open space back to the trailhead (3.2 miles : 6,030').

109,Eagle Wind Trail ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,3.95,5530,5530,336,Easy-Moderate,Yes," 	140 million years ago the Rabbit Mountain area marked the western shore of an inland sea that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico to the Hudson Bay. It was tropical lowland covered by rivers, swamps and lagoons. This sea retreated approximately 65M years ago when tectonic forces pulled the earth's crust, resulting in a western uplift that formed the Rockies.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The uplift's ripples caused rocks to compress and bulge at its base, creating anticlines  - or convex folds on the earth's surface. As the bulging anticline's softer sediments eroded, only hard ridges - known as Hogbacks - remained from the previously rounded hilltops.  Rabbit Mountain's position three miles east of similar anticline formations along the Front Range is unique. The complex movements of two faults in the area pushed these eroding anticlines east, and with a rare orientation: their steepest sides face east, and gentler slopes to the west. 	This unusual location and orientation make it a natural landmark visible from three counties. Today Rabbit Mountain stands along this divisive uplift between the Saint Vrain drainage basin (south) and Big Thompson drainage basin (north). 	Here the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountain upslope, a rich ecological juxtaposition that brings plant and wildlife communities together from each.

Groomed trails, mild grades, and a bucolic setting welcome runners, cyclists, birdwatchers, and skiers.   The following description begins at the Teller Farms - South Trailhead and travels north: The East Boulder Trail heads east on a wide gravel path to the Teller Lake spur (.2 miles) and bends north. It moves easily through the ranch, making several dog-leg turns along property lines before straightening out for lengthy spell (.75 miles). The path is crossed by several creeks and irrigation ditches lined by old-growth cottonwood stands, ideal places to see hawks, eagles and owls - especially in the bareness of winter. The trail passes through a cattle gate (1.95 miles) and into the Teller Farms - North Trailhead parking lot on Valmont Road (2.15 miles : 5,125').  It exits the northwest corner of the lot and traces Valmont Road for .25 miles before crossing north into the White Rocks Trailhead parking lot (2.4 miles : 5,092').   The trail officially enters the White Rocks Nature Preserve - Lower Boulder Creek Conservation Area and skirts a large pond home to a diverse waterfowl population. It continues over South Boulder Creek to the base of a ridge comprised of the eponymous white rocks and forks left (3.45 miles : 5,085'). The trail narrows and begins a moderate climb with panoramas of Boulder's front range, and useful perspective on the patchwork landscape through which you're passing.

The Rawhide Loop begins from the West Access Trailhead - the following description travels counter-clockwise: 	The trail heads northeast on the edge of a vast meadow with rangy views across rolling hills and surrounding mountains. It passes the Longhorn Trail split (.27 miles : 7,425'), curls north and begins a rugged, moderately steep descent into a gulch at the first of two Wrangler Run Trail connections (.65 miles : 7,125'). 	The trail rises back and levels briefly with views across the Eastern Plains and Denver skyline (1.05 miles : 7,315'). It gradually bends northwest and resumes a quick pace through intervals of steep undulations and relaxing flats. 	Travel eases along a high ridge and service road in the Rawhide Trail's northeast corner (1.95 miles : 7,450'). Here you'll enjoy views across the Loop's inner meadows and southwest mountains that frame it. Continue past the Water Hole Trail spur (2.05 miles : 7,465') - which leads to the Sourdough Springs Equestrian Camp - and veer off the service (left) to remain on the Rawhide Trail. 	Mild undulations lead out from the timber and level across open slopes carpeted with lupine, arnica, paintbrush, aster, thistle, blanket flowers and mariposa lily (2.5 miles : 7,530'). The trail moves quickly through fire-scarred pine stands (2.75 miles) to the second Waterhole Trail spur and Campsites 1-4 (3.0 miles : 7,410'). 	Bear right to continue on the Rawhide Trail, now a wide graded service road you'll follow through open meadows back to the trailhead. 	The trial rolls gently along the Loop's open west side past the 2nd Wrangler Run Trail connection (3.6 miles : 7,290') and Belcher Hill Trail split (4.4 miles : 7,465') to complete the Loop (4.7 miles). This final segment offers broad views across the Rawhide's inner meadows and Ralston Buttes, a geological uplift north of White Ranch Park that serves as an important wildlife corridor from the mountains to the plains. 	The Rawhide Loop Trail circles White Ranch Park's highest meadows and rolling hills with varied terrain and exceptional views throughout.

123,Sawmill Trail ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,2.95,7510,7608,98,Easy,Yes," White Ranch Park supports nearly 20 miles of well-maintained multi-use trails that stretch through open grasslands and mixed pine forests.  The Sawmill Trail begins at the West Access Trailhead and leads to the Sourdough Campground, continuing a short distance to its abrupt conclusion at the Mustang Trail.   Though primarily used for campground access, the Sawmill Trail offers convenient connections to the Rawhide, Belcher Hill, and Mustang trails for lengthier routes through the Park.   The Sawmill Trail begins on the south side of the parking lot and glides gently down a grassy meadow on narrow singletrack. It merges with a graded service road (.42 miles : 7,425') and continues south  to a ridge and the Belcher Hill Trail split (.65 miles : 7,462').   The Sawmill bends sharply west and levels across a hillside to the Sourdough Campground and spur for Campsites 11-14 (1.05 miles : 7,570'); a few steps ahead is the spur for Campsites 15-20 (1.15 miles : 7,590'). The Sawmill Trail narrows once more beyond the campground and undulates with greater intensity above a deep ravine to the south.  The hillside above is busy with an attractive collection of wildflowers, rocky outcrops, felled logs, and tree stumps. Views south and west improve as the trail nears its end at the Mustang Trail junction (1.47 miles : 7,608').  For a longer more varied trip, consider returning via the Mustang and Belcher Hill trails.  These form a nice loop through varied terrain with excellent northerly views on the return.

124,Shorthorn to Longhorn Trail ,boulder-denver-golden-fort-collins-lyons,5.2,7600,6925,-675,Moderate,Yes," White Ranch Park supports nearly 20 miles of well-maintained multi-use trails that stretch through open grasslands, steep hillsides and mixed pine forests.  The well-plotted trail network provides numerous routing options of varying length and difficulty. The Shorthorn Trail is a 1.1 mile trail segment accessed from either end of the Longhorn Trail (see map).  The Shorthorn Trail is a shorter alternative to the Longhorn Trail, shaving nearly .5 miles off its one-way distance.   The following description begins from the West Access Trailhead and follows the Longhorn Trail to the Shorthorn Trail. Head north on the Rawhide Trail to its connection with the Longhorn Trail (.25 miles). Enjoy rangy views over high open space, and several marked remains of a working ranch that occupied this land prior to its donation to Jefferson County Open Space. The Rawhide Trail joins the Longhorn Trail after .25 miles.  Turn right and begin a steady descent through a sparse pine forest to the Shorthorn Trail split in about a mile and veer right. The Shorthorn Trail runs just beneath the top of a bluff on a narrow, rugged path that sees light mountain bike traffic.   The first .75 miles offer little shade, but terrific views to the north and east.   The final .4 miles have short, steep undulations through a forested area.  The trail rejoins the Longhorn Trail after 1.1 miles (2.6 miles from the trailhead), then drops steeply to its end at the Belcher Hill Trail intersection. For a longer option, consider continuing southeast on the Belcher Hill Trail to the East Access Parking Lot and Trailhead (adding 3.4 miles roundtrip).  For a shorter though predictably more crowded return, turn west (right) on the Belcher Hill Trail and connect with the Sawmill Trail, which leads back to the West Access Parking Lot and Trailhead (only a 1.7 mile return).

125,Alcove Nature Trail ,colorado-national-monument,0.9,5815,5863,48,Easy,No," The Alcove Nature Trail is a short trail with over 30 interpretive markers along the way. Each marker identifies a specific characteristic of the Colorado National Monument including the park's flora, fauna, geology and anthropology. The trail itself runs through a pygmy forest of Juniper and Pinyon Pine trees also showcasing the park's other vegetation such as cheat grass, yucca and mountain mahogany.  A large wall of colorful Entrada Sandstone lines the hike to its terminus, ending in a surreal box canyon with sandstone walls rising 100' around you. Make note of the extremely smooth sandstone walls, sculpted by million of years of erosion. The temperature also immediately drops at least 15 degrees in this part of the nature trail. The Alcove Nature Trail is highly recommended as the starting point for your exploration of the park. It provides a wealth of useful information sure to enhance your entire experience.  *Be sure to purchase an interpretive pamphlet as it will guide you from marker to marker. ",,,
126,Black Ridge Trail ,colorado-national-monument,11.2,5815,6535,720,Moderate,No," The Black Ridge Trail offers visitors a chance to escape the red-rock canyons and experience the green-topped mesas and pinyon-juniper pygmy forests of the upper Colorado Plateau. This trail follows the Old Fruita Dugway, a pioneer-era road built in the 1880's used to drive cattle between the nascent towns of Fruita and Glade Park. The trail follows Black Ridge, whose elevation affords brilliant views in almost every direction. Visible from the ridge are the Bookcliffs formation, Grand Mesa, Canyonlands National Park in Utah as well as the San Juan Mountains over 80 miles to the southeast. Starting from the trailhead across Rim Rock Road from the Visitor's Center, the trail begins a brief yet sharp ascent up the Old Fruita Dugway, now a gravel fire road. At about .5 miles, the trail levels out as you leave Colorado National Monument and enter land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). This boundary is marked by a signed fence letting you know that you are no longer in the park.  Shortly after entering BLM land, the trail heads west up a sandstone bench lined with Juniper trees. The Juniper trees' long, thick roots grow directly out of and into the sandstone, illustrating their amazing resilience to harsh climates. Views of the Bookcliffs and Grand Mesa are particularly good along this stretch. At the 1.1 mile mark, the trail levels out and enters a Juniper - Pinyon Pygmy forest. In this area, Juniper and Pinyon Pine trees grow very short, thus the name 'pygmy' forest. At 1.5 miles, the forest opens up to reveal wide open grass plains dotted with Sagebrush, Juniper and Pinyon Pine trees. These grasslands and sage flats are a welcome contrast to the red-rock that dominates the lower canyons of the park. Shortly after the land opens up, at 1.8 miles, the McInnis Canyons National Conservation Area is visible to the west. Controlled by the BLM, this area greatly illustrates the striking landscape of Colorado canyon country. Multi-hued sandstone fills this gorge and it is worth stopping for a moment to spot for wildlife. Continue hiking past the McInnis Canyons overlook. After crossing a white sandstone bridge, you re-enter the beautiful, wide-open grasslands of the Colorado Plateau.  Climbing steadily now, 'badland' formations begin to reveal themselves at the 2.7 mile mark. Red and green hued sediment appears to be breaking out of the grassy hillsides creating formations similar to those found in Badlands National Park. At 2.9 miles (6,520') the trail re-enters the Colorado National Monument via a chained gate. Steps are provided to hop over the wooden fence, or a linked chain can be unwound to open the gate. At 3.5 miles (6,560') you reach the trail split for the C.C.C. Trail (C.C.C. stands for Civilian Conservation Corps). This is a short trail that connects Monument Canyon and the Black Ridge Trail. Views are brilliant to the northeast from this point. At 4.2 miles (6,800') the trail begins the descent down to the south trailhead. The landscape quickly returns to its desert appearance, becoming noticeably warmer, drier and quite rocky. At 4.9 miles the trail becomes an easy fire road, marking the final .7 mile descent through colorful rocky outcrops. At 5.6 miles (6,535') the trail comes to its terminus at Rim Rock Road, with the Liberty Cap Trailhead located across the street. ",,,

128,No Thoroughfare Canyon Trail ,colorado-national-monument,6.1,4990,5648,658,Moderate,No," No Thoroughfare Canyon is accessed from the Devils Kitchen Trailhead in Colorado National Monument (East Entrance Station). This remote canyon runs approximately 8.5 miles from Rim Rock Road to Little Park Road along the Monument's south boundary. Trail Map | Photo Gallery A maintained trail leads 2 miles in to a seasonal waterfall, where a primitive route continues another mile to a second waterfall. Strenuous x-country travel resumes up-canyon to its terminus on Little Park Road. Only experienced hikers should attempt travel past the second waterfall. The following describes travel to the second waterfall, a popular day hike distinguished by water, lush vegetation and diverse geological features. Bighorn sheep may also be seen in the canyon: The trail dips through open desert at the mouth of the canyon to the Devils Kitchen - No Thoroughfare Canyon Trail split (.25 miles : 4,955'). Sage and sprawling cactus beds fill this colorful expanse. The trail bends west into the lower canyon and follows a stream bed up to the Pool (1.05 miles : 5,080'). Steep stairs climb over the pool and drop back into the wash, a narrow riparian corridor hemmed by dark Precambrian rock - a sharp contrast to crimson sandstones more typical in the Monument. The trail rises up the narrow channel on modest, variously rugged grades to the First Waterfall (1.95 miles : 5,295'). The seasonal fall pours over a towering alcove into a large pool ringed by shady cottonwoods and leafy vegetation. The trail - now a primitive route - continues up the right side of the waterfall on a very steep, rugged climb to a level area in the middle canyon (2.05 miles : 5,458'). Note the trail's location here, as the exact descent point may be tricky to find on the hike back. Enjoy great views back down canyon and out toward the Book Cliffs from this high point. The route continues up canyon on a fairly well-defined boot track that negotiates intervals of thick, potentially head-high brush. Be patient with route finding and avoid placing your hands or feet where you can't see them. If off course, simply follow the central wash, a verdant line of cottonwoods, willow, grasses and pools. A progressively rugged and obfuscated path leads to the Second Waterfall (3.05 miles : 5,648'), a sunny area less likely to hold water than the first. For those continuing on, look for cairns on the right side of the wash before arriving at the waterfall. These cairns mark a steep climb above/around the waterfall, which is typically not scalable due to pitch and wet rock. Anticipate slow travel beyond this point, and plan resources accordingly.

This large sandstone dome along the Ute Canyon rim is a 160 M year old sand dune that's been compressed into sandstone and sculpted by erosion. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Liberty Cap Trail winds gently down Monument Mesa through pinyon-juniper woodlands and open sage flats to the formation, and continues another 2 miles to its eastern terminus on Wildwood Drive. While Liberty Cap is the primary destination, lengthy slickrock benches and views over Ute Canyon are the Liberty Cap Trail's main attraction: The Liberty Cap Trail heads through a pinyon-juniper forest to the first of several open sage flats, which are good places to find wildlife (1.15 miles : 6,490'). Remain on the trail to avoid damaging biological soil crusts which cover this area. Views of Monument Canyon (north), Ute Canyon (south), and the Book Cliffs (horizon) emerge as you progress down the mesa. At 3.4 miles (6,230') a cairn-marked spur branches .15 miles north to the Monument Canyon rim, a worthwhile excursion. The trail moderates along the Ute Canyon rim (4.0 miles : 6,162') before edging back into the woodlands and dropping to a set of steep, rugged, and tightly wound switchbacks (5.05 miles : 5,982'). Anticipate drop-offs on this short section. The trail abruptly levels to Liberty Cap, located on a slickrock saddle high along the Ute Canyon rim (5.2 miles : 5,902'). Views of Grand Junction, the Colorado River valley, and Ute Canyon are exceptional from this large, open area.

131,Monument Canyon Trail ,colorado-national-monument,11.6,6140,4722,-1418,Moderate,No," The Monument Canyon Trail is the quintessence of Colorado National Monument. Rangers will tell you that if you have time for only one long trail, this is it.  The trail begins at Monument Canyon's Upper Trailhead and drops 900' in just .9 miles to the canyon floor. This initial descent follows 50M years of geological history including sedimentary rock deposited during the Upper Jurassic and Upper Triassic periods of the Mesozoic Era. As you descend, you will notice several different layers, all with their own unique characteristics that helped to create these sheer walls and rock formations. The rock layers, from top to bottom:  Layer 1 = Variegated sandstone and mudstone layers of the Tidwell Member of the Morrison and Wanakah Formations Layer 2 = Salmon-colored slickrock formations of the Entrada Sandstone family Layer 3 = Very resistant, darker colored and bench-forming Kayenta Sandstone Layer 4 = Towering, sheer walled and cliff forming Wingate Sandstone layer Layer 5 = The crumbly, red-brick colored rock of the Chinle Formation  Below the Chinle Formation lies two types of harder metamorphic rock from the Precambrian period called gneiss and schist. Upon reaching the canyon floor, Pinyon Pine and Juniper Trees dominate the landscape as Yucca plants and Mormon Tea abound. The canyon floor is rife with Wildlife including mule deer, desert cottontail and desert bighorn sheep. If you look close, signs are life are everywhere. The trail flattens out on the canyon floor and skirts the sheer red-rock walls. At the 1.8 mile mark, the canyon opens up to reveal the giant red-rock monolith formations that give Monument Canyon its name. Within view from a distance are the impressive Pipe Organ, Praying Hands and Kissing Couple formations, all of which get closer as the trail continues. The next 1.5 miles undulate along the canyon floor with good views of Pipe Organ, Praying Hands and Independence Monument along the way. Independence Monument, a 450' high red-rock formation is where John Otto, the founder of Colorado National Monument, was married. It was he who first created this 'trail' in hopes that one day it would be made an official monument. In 1911, the area was declared an official monument. Also visible from this spot is Window Rock, an arch-like formation easily identified in the distance. Upon passing the famous monoliths, at 4.2 miles the trail begins a steady descent on its way to the lower trailhead. Look for signs of Desert Bighorn Sheep along this stretch, as they are frequently spotted in this area of the monument. At 5.0 miles (4,768') the trail levels past a sign-in sheet for the lower Monument Canyon trailhead.

132,Ute Canyon Trail ,colorado-national-monument,8.0,6440,5570,-870,Moderate,No," The Ute Canyon Trailhead is located on Rim Rock Road, 9.5 miles from the visitor center in Colorado National Monument. The Ute Canyon Trail drops 515' in just half a mile to the canyon floor, where an unimproved but well-defined route leads through a fecund riparian corridor to the Corkscrew Trail in the lower canyon. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The 4 mile trail is highlighted by lush and varied vegetation, stunning sandstone walls and abundant wildlife. Those with time may continue .9 miles on the Corkscrew to Liberty Cap, a 160 million year old lithified sand dune along the north canyon wall: The trail drops steeply from Rim Rock Drive on tightly wound switchbacks to the upper canyon floor (.5 miles : 5,925'). Grades level considerably here and remain so much of the way. A well-cut track turns south (right) and follows the main streambed through dense intervals of cottonwood, willow and tall grasses, a great stretch to see birds and bedded down mammals. The trail runs up and down a knoll to circumvent Precambrian gneiss slots at 1.0 mile (5,919'), depositing you back in the main streambed at a major dogleg (left) in the canyon (1.15 miles : 5,825'). Though well-marked, take note of this decisive turn for the return hike. A clear path continues down-canyon through a diverse collection of pinyon, juniper, sage and native grasses. Mature cryptobiotic soil crusts cover the ground, an essential element to desert life. Cryptobiotic soil is a living ground that conducts photosynthesis and fixes nitrogen used by other plants. When wet, Cyanobacteria moves through the soil and binds particles, forming a fibrous mesh that stabilizes the surface, holds water and reduces wind erosion. Travel quickens through a drier and expanding landscape in the lower canyon. Look for an arch carved like a slit high up on the south canyon wall about two miles from the trailhead. You'll cross dark rock slabs at 3.5 miles (5,612'), past which contrastingly bright crimson soils lead to the first of two Corkscrew Trail junctions (4.0 miles : 5,570').  This is the official end of the Ute Canyon Trail, but you may continue .9 miles and 325' up to Liberty Cap (note most of this elevation is gained on a short section of switchbacks). View this map for complete route details. The Ute Canyon Trailhead is located on Rim Rock Road, 9.5 miles from the visitor center in Colorado National Monument. The Ute Canyon Trail drops 515' in just half a mile to the canyon floor, where an unimproved but well-defined route leads through a fecund riparian corridor to the Corkscrew Trail in the lower canyon.Trail Map | Photo GalleryThe 4 mile trail is highlighted by lush and varied vegetation, stunning sandstone walls and abundant wildlife. Those with time may continue .9 miles on the Corkscrew to Liberty Cap, a 160 million year old lithified sand dune along the north canyon wall:The trail drops steeply from Rim Rock Drive on tightly wound switchbacks to the upper canyon floor (.5 miles : 5,925'). Grades level considerably here and remain so much of the way.A well-cut track turns south (right) and follows the main streambed through dense intervals of cottonwood, willow and tall grasses, a great stretch to see birds and bedded down mammals.The trail runs up and down a knoll to circumvent Precambrian gneiss slots at 1.0 mile (5,919'), depositing you back in the main streambed at a major dogleg (left) in the canyon (1.15 miles : 5,825'). Though well-marked, take note of this decisive turn for the return hike.A clear path continues down-canyon through a diverse collection of pinyon, juniper, sage and native grasses. Mature cryptobiotic soil crusts cover the ground, an essential element to desert life.Cryptobiotic soil is a living ground that conducts photosynthesis and fixes nitrogen used by other plants. When wet, Cyanobacteria moves through the soil and binds particles, forming a fibrous mesh that stabilizes the surface, holds water and reduces wind erosion.Travel quickens through a drier and expanding landscape in the lower canyon. Look for an arch carved like a slit high up on the south canyon wall about two miles from the trailhead.You'll cross dark rock slabs at 3.5 miles (5,612'), past which contrastingly bright crimson soils lead to the first of two Corkscrew Trail junctions (4.0 miles : 5,570').

133,Window Rock Trail ,colorado-national-monument,0.5,5730,5682,-48,Easy,No," Located within the Saddlehorn Campground and a stone's throw from the Visitor's Center, the Window Rock Trail is an easy trail which leads to terrific views of Monument and Wedding Canyons. Also visible from the overlook is Window Rock, a natural widening crack in the Wingate sandstone formed by pounding erosive forces. The Window Rock Trail, like the Canyon Rim Trail, stands on a ledge of Kayenta Sandstone, a more resistant form of this sedimentary rock. Deposited over 200 million years ago, the Kayenta layer is found throughout the park on top of the Wingate Sandstone layer, which forms the sheer high walls of Monument and Wedding Canyons. Due to constant erosion, the official Window Trail is sometimes difficult to follow. However, since the area is open for exploration, the trail is almost unnecessary. ",,,
134,Exploring the Sand Sheet ,great-sand-dunes-national-park,10.5,8160,7910,240,Moderate,Yes," The Great Sand Dunes cover 30 square miles at the base of the Sangre de Cristo mountains in the San Luis Valley. They're America's tallest dunes, formed through a complex interaction of geology, topography and water. Trail Map | Photo Gallery While the dunes are the Park's main attraction, few venture into the surrounding Sand Sheet, which holds approximately 90% of the area's sand mass and is the largest component of the dunes' geological system. The San Luis Valley lies between the San Juan Mountains (west), and Sangre de Cristo Mountains (NE). Sediments from these mountains were carried down over millennia into the valley and covered by ancient lakes. As lakes evaporated, an expansive sand sheet remained that is the primary source of today's sand dunes. Grass and shrublands stabilize the sand sheet, which extends from the base of the dunes for many miles into the valley. This subtly rich ecosystem supports deer, elk, pronghorn, burrowing owls, coyote, and rabbit. No trails lead into the sand sheet; visitors are free to explore the open shrublands, parabolic dunes and nebkha dunes that form at the dune-sheet juxtaposition. There are several ways to access the sand sheet, each requiring cross-country travel for several miles. One route begins at the Visitor Center, and runs south down Medano Creek into vast open space at the dunes' south end. This option is arguably the easiest, but offers limited perspective. Another begins at the Entrance Station, where you may park and walk through open prairie toward / around the entire dune complex (see map for routing). This longer route offers terrific views of the dunefield, wildlife viewing, and a chance to examine all dune types in a short space (Reversing, Star, Parabolic, Barchan, Transverse, and Nebkha).  Visual navigation is quite simple, though hidden undulations and extended travel through sand requires effort. Visitors are responsible for knowing private property lines imbedded within Park boundaries. Carry a detailed map, and inform Park officials of your itinerary before setting out.

135,Sand Dune Trail ,great-sand-dunes-national-park,2.5,8085,8605,520,Moderate,Yes," The Great Sand Dunes are North America's tallest dunes, spanning 30 square miles where the San Luis Valley meets the Sangre de Cristo mountains. No trails lead into the dunes - visitors are free to explore the main dunefield, Medano Creek and outlying Sand Sheet from various access points. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The shortest route begins at the main parking lot just past the Visitor Center on the east side of the dunefield, and leads over Medano Creek to the base of the dunes (.2 miles : 8,140'). From there it's an arduous climb up the Park's steepest dunes to the first ridge (.75 miles : 8,600'), which offers panoramic views across the dune field, Medano Creek, and Sangre de Cristos Mt Herard (13,297'), Cleveland Peak (13,414'), Tijeras Peak (13,604'), Kit Carson Peak (14,165') and Music Mountain (13,355') are just a few of the 35+ peaks in this range exceeding 13,000'. Those with time can aim for High Dune, located about 1.5 miles from the parking lot at 8,790' (approx). Dune Formation The Great Sand Dunes' origin is a complex interaction of geology, topography, and water.The San Luis Valley lies between the San Juan Mountains (west), and Sangre de Cristo Mountains (northeast). Over millennia, sediments from these mountains were drawn down into the valley and covered by ancient lakes. As ancient lakes in the valley evaporated, loose sediment was lifted by prevailing southwest winds toward the base of the Sangre de Cristo mountains. When sand particles can go no further, wind churns the blocked sand into very fine particles and deposits them at or near the base of the obstacle. Seasonal storm patterns bring opposing winds from the northeast, blowing new and old sand back onto itself that accumulates vertically, which account for the dunes' extraordinary height. Medano Creek recycles sand each spring along the southeast edge of the dunefield, while Sand Creek resupplies the west side. Medano Creek's heavy deposits are responsible for creating the tallest dunes, which are located directly above the creek. Vegetation on the dune perimeter (known as the Sand Sheet) has stabilized loose sediment, neutralizing growth. Photos dating back to 1874 suggest the dune footprint has changed little, despite many shifts within the established complex.

Head to the northeast shore for terrific views up-valley that include Mount Toll (12,979'), Mt Audubon (13,223') and Little Pawnee Peak (12,466'). 	Mitchell Lake straddles an ecological transition zone between the subalpine and alpine tundra. Just below Mitchell Lake is a tall spruce-fir forest; a slight rise in elevation sees a rapidly thinning forest comprised of krummholz - a German word meaning twisted wood. 	Krummholz describes the stunted, irregular growth patterns of trees in the transition zone. Poor soil, thin air, strong winds, and extreme weather limit and deform growth at these elevations. Higher up the valley wooded vegetation disappears altogether, replaced by the alpine tundra's hardy grasses, mosses and lichens. 	Most alpine plants are perennials, some are dwarfed, but their blossoms may be full-sized. Flowering plants often have dense hairs on stems and leaves for wind protection, or pigments capable of converting sunlight into heat. 	Cushion plants avoid wind by growing close to the ground, and anchor themselves with long taproots. Grasses and sedges take hold in richer soil beds. 	Non-flowering lichens can photosynthesize above 32 degrees, and outer fungal layers can absorb more than their own weight in water.

144,Mt Audubon ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,7.9,10508,13223,2715,Strenuous,Yes," Mt Audubon is located 3.95 miles from Mitchell Lake Trailhead in the Brainard Lake Recreation Area. It's the 6th tallest peak in the Indian Peaks Wilderness, and highest with a maintained trail up to the summit. Visitors will enjoy miles of open tundra with big views across the Indian Peaks and Rocky Mountain National Park. 65% of this trail runs above treeline. Anticipate variable weather conditions, and get an early start to avoid afternoon thunderstorms: Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail begins on a mild grade that banks sharply left at .25 miles (an important mark when snow covered) up to a break in the forest against the steep south flank of Mt Audubon (.72 miles : 10,856'). The trail turns right on steep switchbacks with expanding views of Mitchell Lake, Little Pawnee Peak (12,466') and Mt Toll (12,979'). Tall spruce give way to krummholz, willow, forbs and sedges on the rapid transition through treeline (1.4 miles : 11,238'). Anticipate rocky conditions much of the way, and lingering snow through mid-summer. The next two miles lead through steep, open tundra on a rather direct, cairn-marked route to the summit. The trail bears left at the Beaver Creek Trail split (1.7 miles : 11,375') with a good look at Longs Peak (14,259') and Mt Meeker (13,911') to the north. Travel briefly moderates across a wide flat (2.05 miles : 11,650') with partial views of Mt Toll, Navajo Peak, Apache Peak, Shoshoni Peak, and Pawnee Peak. It pushes through a few steep switchbacks (2.5 - 2.75 miles : 11,977' - 12,144') to a saddle with social routes branching off to two unnamed peaks to the north. These peaks (12,706' and 12,114') are good x-country alternatives to the busy Audubon summit, offering solitude and views across Coney Flats and Rocky Mountain's Wild Basin Area. The main trail curls north of the summit and levels on a saddle directly beneath it (3.5 miles : 12,700'), positioning you for the final .45 mile - 523' climb through a rugged talus field. A large cairn and rock barrier span the trail, a signal for you to turn left into the talus. It's possible to overshoot this demarcation, but you'll quickly find yourself staring down a perilous drop to Upper Coney Lake (10,940'). Identify cairns before heading into the talus. The path is vague at best - even with cairns' guidance - and it's likely you'll discover several alternative routes along the way. Proceed cautiously and follow the most direct path to the summit (3.95 miles : 13,223').

Though no maintained trails reach Mt Toll, well-established cross-country routes lead approximately two miles past Blue Lake (11,355') to the summit. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The routes are not technical when free of snow, but still physically demanding and should only be attempted by experienced hikers. Visitors will enjoy several lakes, abundant flowers and miles of open alpine travel on the hike to Mt Toll: The trail moves quickly to Mitchell Lake, which occupies a damp flat at the base of Mt Audubon (.85 miles : 10,725'). It crosses Mitchell Lake's inlet (1.1 miles) and steepens into the center of the valley above several outlying lakes. Look for moose in this willow-lined corridor. The trail undulates through treeline to a wide cascade and crests just above the east shore of Blue Lake (2.55 miles : 11,355'). Blue Lake fills a large rock basin framed by Little Pawnee Peak (south), Mount Toll and Paiute Peak (west) and Mt Audubon (north). Here the maintained trail ends and you must choose your route to Mt Toll, determined by which shore of Blue Lake you'll climb to reach the upper valley. Ultimately you'll need to be in the southwest corner of the valley for a non-technical ascent, so the most direct approach is up the south shore. The north shore route is longer but more scenic, highlighted by Upper Blue Lake and long stretches of open snowfields. The following description scales the north shore of Blue Lake into the upper valley: Follow the social trail around Blue Lake's north shore to begin the first climb (2.75 miles : 11,379'). Though marked by cairns, thick brush, snow and talus make the exact path difficult to follow. Keep an intuitive heading into the upper valley, which widens considerably as you progress. The cross-country route levels on a wide, rocky bench about 100 yards from Upper Blue Lake (3.35 miles : 11,901'), which fills a rocky depression between Mt Toll and Paiute Peak. Here you must begin making your way south across the valley. From Upper Blue Lake, scale the talus slope to the south, which crests over a massive perennial snow bowl. Drop into the bowl and aim for the southwest corner of the valley. Once across (3.95 miles : 12,090'), you must climb a near-vertical wall to reach the saddle between Little Pawnee Peak and Mt Toll. Improvise your way up, avoiding slick snow and loose rock. Travel levels on the saddle between Little Pawnee and Toll with your first glimpse over the divide (4.25 miles : 12,540'). Identify a good line up Mt Toll's south side for the .3 mile, 439' push to the summit. While the terrain is initially clear, talus quickly absorbs any path you take and requires a very careful scramble to the summit. Remain patient and steer clear of drop offs and couloirs. The Mt Toll summit (4.55 miles : 12,979') is small and pointy with one rock wind shelter.

Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Niwot Ridge Trail passes through the 1200 hectare Niwot Ridge Biosphere Reserve, established in 1979 for the study of alpine tundra. Visitors will enjoy diverse alpine landscapes, good trail conditions and arguably some of the best views in the Indian Peaks: The trail follows a level path to the Jean Lunning Trail (.2 miles) and veers left over Long Lake's outlet. It continues clockwise to an unmarked split (left) for the Niwot Ridge Cutoff Trail (.4 miles : 10,558'). The trail enters a spruce forest at the base of Niwot Ridge and climbs methodically up its north face on long, winding switchbacks. This section is well-defined but can be obstructed by deadfall and snow. The trail clears treeline (1.65 miles : 11,220') and moderates through open tundra to the first of two Niwot Ridge Biosphere Reserve markers (1.75 miles : 11,275'). Here it bends decisively south for a saddle in the lower, eastern portion of the ridge. Behind you (north) are views of Longs Peak (14,259'), Mt Meeker (13,911') and Mt Audubon (13,223'); to the east a good look over Left Hand Park Reservoir. Look for ptarmigan, marmot, elk, moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat in the open tundra. The trail passes a second Niwot Ridge Biosphere marker (2.3 miles : 11,425'), crests on the ridge's saddle (2.6 miles : 11,460') and drops south to a 4x4 road. The valley ahead is part of the Boulder Watershed, a chain of lakes framed by Kiowa Peak (13,276') and Arikaree Peak (13,150'). The trail fades but is adequately marked by cairns to its convergence with the road and official Niwot Ridge Trail (2.9 miles : 11,407'). The road-trail rises steadily up the south-side of Niwot Ridge with great views across the open tundra and valley below. Watershed boundary markers and research facilities line the way for guidance. In 4.1 miles the trail bends north for the ridge's high, narrow center with simultaneous views of the Watershed and South St Vrain Creek valleys. Perennial snow clings to upper valley walls, the water system's primary benefactors. Navajo Peak (13,409'), Apache Peak (13,441'), Shoshoni Peak (12,967') and Isabelle Glacier (12,025') emerge to the west and north as the trail levels on the ridge top. The trail reaches the last research post and cairn marking its unofficial end (5.05 miles : 12,285'). You may continue west to Navajo Peak and the Divide, or roll north for a look over the Isabelle Glacier valley. Honor the Watershed boundary, which extends all the way to the Divide. The Niwot Ridge Trail climbs 1800' from the Long Lake Trailhead to a narrow, divisive ridge between the South St Vrain Creek and North Boulder Creek drainages.

147,Paiute Peak ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,8.6,10525,13088,2563,Strenuous,Yes,"  Paiute Peak (13,088') is located in the Indian Peaks Wilderness between Mt Audubon and Mt Toll. No trail reaches the summit, however two non-technical routes from the Mitchell Lake Trailhead offer access.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The first and longer route scales Mt Audubon on a well-maintained trail, and continues along its rugged west ridge to Paiute Peak. There's some class III scrambling on this approach, but most find it on par with other ascents in the area.  The second follows a moderate trail to Blue Lake, and a more challenging social route to Little Blue Lake. From here you must locate a steep couloir that climbs 850' in just .4 miles to the summit. 	No matter how you tackle it, Paiute Peak offers exceptional views of its two iconic neighbors, and across the northern Indian Peaks, Coney Lake valley and Rocky Mountain National Park. 	The following description takes the Blue Lake route, preferable for its more varied alpine terrain and freedom from trails after a shorter distance: 	The trail moves quickly to Mitchell Lake, which occupies a marshy flat at the base of Mt Audubon (.85 miles : 10,725'). It crosses Mitchell Lake's inlet (1.1 miles) and steepens into the center of the valley above several outlying ponds. Look for moose in this willow-lined corridor 	The trail undulates through treeline to a wide cascade and crests just above the east shore of Blue Lake (2.55 miles : 11,355'). A well-defined trail continues along and up the north side of Blue Lake for a short time before losing clarity in the open landscape. 	Cairns offer guidance, but rugged terrain will likely force some improvisation up to Little Blue Lake at the base of Paiute and Audubon (3.25 miles : 11,833'). 	The couloir you must find is located directly above the steep talus slope on the far side of Little Blue Lake. You can take this difficult section head-on, but it's easier to follow a longer route up a ridge that wraps the south side of the lake (3.65 miles : 12,059'). 	This uneven section levels in the valley's upper basin, where at least one large cairn marks the base of the correct couloir on the southeast face of Paiute Peak (3.88 miles : 12,238'). 	From here it's nothing fancy - just a very steep push on loose scree and sand until reaching terra firma in a rocky notch with views west of the Divide (4.15 miles : 12,843'). 	The ground stabilizes while threading talus up to a second notch with a great look at Longs Peak. Continue the intuitive scramble up to Paiute Peak (4.27 miles : 13,088'). 	Views are incredible from the summit, notably of Upper Coney Lake and Coney Lake (north), Mt Audubon (east) and Mt Toll and Pawnee Peak (south across the valley). Paiute Peak has a distinct cleft summit, with the summit register located on the first 'lobe'. 	Keep track of your route to the summit, because the couloir may be tricky to locate on the return - any other route can prove difficult if not dangerous. On the descent, anticipate sliding rocks and be prepared to get out of your own way. 	It's also possible to return via the Audubon ridge, which is easy to identify. This adds nominal distance and forms a great loop back to Mitchell Lake Trailhead. Be mindful of time on the exposed and slow-going Audubon ridge if weather approaches.

It lies at treeline west of the Continental Divide in a steep-walled valley below Pawnee Pass. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Pawnee Lake is accessible from Monarch Lake (west of the Divide) via the Cascade Creek Trail, but the east-west route from Brainard Lake offers a decidedly more scenic trek that includes Long Lake, Lake Isabelle, Pawnee Pass and four miles of spectacular travel over treeline. It follows the Pawnee Pass Trail up to the Divide, then drops 1665' in just 1.85 miles to the lake. The trail is strenuous in both directions, particularly the climb from Pawnee Lake back to Pawnee Pass. Backpackers will have little trouble timing their ascent to avoid weather, but day hikers should plan for a strenuous day that may include waiting out storms before it's safe to return: The trail moves quickly up the north shore of Long Lake past two connections for the Jean Lunning Trail (1.2 miles : 10,674'). Travel steepens (1.85 miles) in a thinning forest to Lake Isabelle and the Pawnee Pass Trail split (2.1 miles : 10,892'). The Pawnee Pass Trail climbs steeply over Lake Isabelle on a shifting path that clears treeline and edges to the north side of the valley (2.8 miles : 11,425'). It briefly moderates across an alpine bench (3.5 miles : 11,770') with exceptional views that include Navajo Peak (13,409'), Apache Peak (13,441') and Shoshoni Peak (12,967'). Methodical climbing resumes on switchbacks up the north valley wall (3.6 miles : 11,883') before leveling in open tundra to Pawnee Pass and the Continental Divide (4.55 miles : 12,541'). A few steps ahead lead to astonishing views down the west side, and the beginning of a precipitous descent through rugged talus into the capacious Pawnee Lake valley. Rock yields to flower-riddled slopes through 5.4 miles (11,700') across more even terrain. The forest gradually reconstitutes by 6.1 miles (11,150'), where you'll find spurs that branch off for the lake. Backpackers may find established sites off these social trails, but it's otherwise advisable to remain on the designated trail, which offers the most efficient path. Thicker timber signals proximity to the lake, which is now hidden from the trail. Look for a cairn marked spur at 6.37 miles, which veers left to Pawnee Lake (6.4 miles : 10,877'). The lake is hemmed by steep south and west walls, but its east shore is long and accessible, albeit with minor encumbrances. Campers may find more accommodating terrain just above the lake.

151,Buchanan Pass Trail ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,7.7,8755,9630,875,Moderate,Yes," 	The Buchanan Pass Trail begins at Camp Dick off Peak to Peak Highway and runs 9 miles west to Buchanan Pass (11,837') on the Continental Divide. It continues west of the Divide to the Cascade Creek Trail, which leads to Monarch Lake.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The Buchanan Pass Trail offers access to Red Deer Lake, The Gibraltar Lakes, St Vrain Mountain and Gourd Lake along it's long and varied path. Its lower eastern section traces Middle St Vrain Creek through the Indian Peaks' biologically diverse upper-montane ecosystem to Coney Flats.  Visitors will enjoy minimal elevation gains and level footing in a luxuriant forest and streamside setting: 	From the parking area at the west end of Camp Dick, follow Middle St Vrain Road to the Buchanan Pass Trail and backcountry board (.1 mile). Bear right across Middle St Vrain Creek; once over the Buchanan Pass Trail bends west and closely parallels both for the next 3.7 miles. 	The trail is quickly absorbed by aspen, hanging mosses, thick ground cover and large boulders. The creek is generally accessible throughout (audible when not immediately visible), with many eddies and nooks suitable for fishing or a private respite. 	Conditions, scenery and difficulty vary little over the first 1.5 miles; in 1.75 miles the trail climbs more assertively to Timberline Falls (2.2 miles : 9,223'), a deep, staged gorge capped by immense boulders accessible from the trail. 	The falls' energetic chutes can be surveyed from above, or more intimately from two steep social trails - fore and aft - leading down to them.

It continues west of the Divide to the Cascade Creek Trail, which leads to Monarch Lake. Trail Map | Photo Gallery	The Buchanan Pass Trail offers access to Red Deer Lake, The Gibraltar Lakes, St Vrain Mountain and Gourd Lake along it's long and varied path. Its lower eastern section traces Middle St Vrain Creek through the Indian Peaks' biologically diverse upper-montane ecosystem to Coney Flats. Visitors will enjoy minimal elevation gains and level footing in a luxuriant forest and streamside setting:	From the parking area at the west end of Camp Dick, follow Middle St Vrain Road to the Buchanan Pass Trail and backcountry board (.1 mile). Bear right across Middle St Vrain Creek; once over the Buchanan Pass Trail bends west and closely parallels both for the next 3.7 miles.	The trail is quickly absorbed by aspen, hanging mosses, thick ground cover and large boulders.

152,Arapaho Lakes ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,7.1,9211,11172,1961,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," The Arapaho Lakes (11,172') are located 3.65 miles from East Portal Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. The plurality is subjective, as the two main lakes are separated by only a thin band of sedge and talus, making it possible to view, explore and even fish both simultaneously. Trail Map | Photo Gallery While the Forest Lakes Trail corridor is moderate, travel is considerably more difficult on a steep, eroded trail that breaks west up Arapaho Creek to its source at the lakes. Challenging terrain and navigation keep crowds light, making this an ideal choice for equipped hikers during peak summer months: Follow signs right (north) of Moffat Tunnel to the South Boulder Creek Trail; stay on this trail and be mindful of adjacent private property. It rises west of the tunnel through mixed forest and glades to the Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes Trail split (1.25 miles : 9,555'). The Forest Lake Trail bends north to a bridge over Arapaho Creek (1.75 miles : 9,877'). Once over it enters a thick spruce-fir forest and steepens beside the creek to a second Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes Trail split (2.3 miles : 10,185'). Anticipate this point, as the sign may be knocked down. Turn left down to Arapaho Creek. Note that social trails in this vicinity may lead to the creek, but not the precise crossing. The exact point is important to find as what lies beyond lacks clarity. The trail crosses the creek on a dilapidated bridge to the west bank (2.65 miles : 10,299'), and levels north for a short time before making a decisive turn west that begins a strenuous push up-valley. This vague, cluttered segment climbs nearly 650' in just .5 miles along Arapaho Creek. It's likely that you'll lose track once or twice, but easy to regain so long as you stay in audible range. A sudden left-right switchback (2.95 miles : 10,686') signals proximity to more moderate terrain. In 3.2 miles (10,985') the forest thins and travel eases in the upper valley. A better path rises through treeline and bends sharply south across the upper-valley on a final push to the first Arapaho Lake. The main trail deposits you on its NE corner (3.55 miles : 11,172'), from which obstacle-free paths lead to higher points and the second lake. A low ridge over the first lake's east shore yields terrific views and a glimpse of the second, which lies .3 miles west and nearly flush with the first. Walk the first lake's flat south shore to the second, which fills a placid bowl directly below the Divide.

153,Crater Lakes ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,6.0,9211,10600,1389,Moderate,Yes," The Crater Lakes are a cluster of 5 lakes spread about a rugged valley that forms a major tributary to South Boulder Creek. They offer excellent fishing and diverse backcountry camping experiences apart from the crowds. Trail Map | Photo Gallery A maintained but potentially ill-defined trail breaks NW off the East Portal's main artery to lower Crater Lakes, a scenic pair separated only by a thin, elevated ridge. A third lake is concealed by timber nearby, accessible by following either the lower lakes' outlets or established social trails. A strenuous route continues west up a steep wall to the talus-bound cirque of upper Crater Lakes. Carry a good map to maximize time in this feature-filled basin. The following description details mileage to the first set of lakes, followed by general routing to the third lower lake and two upper lakes: Follow signs right (north) of Moffat Tunnel to the South Boulder Creek Trail; stay on this trail and be mindful of adjacent private property. It rises past the tunnel through intervals of aspen, spruce and meadow to the Arapaho Lakes - Forest Lakes Trail split (1.25 miles : 9,555'), and steepens up rugged terrain to the Crater Lakes Trail split (1.85 miles : 9,930'). The Crater Lakes Trail bends north and twists steeply up a cluttered forest. In 2.3 miles (10,095') it banks sharply right, then left on switchbacks marked by rather anonymous cairns; it continues through a slot between two large boulders and exits left to regain the trail. Rugged terrain resumes to a footbridge (2.45 miles : 10,240'), past which travel moderates in stages in a thinning forest to a trail sign along the south lake's outlet stream (2.85 miles : 10,543'). The trail leads north over the outlet to a thin, elevated band of spruce separating the two main lower lakes (2.9 miles 10,630'). Spurs branch off through tightly-spaced trees to the respective lakes - 3.0 miles : 10,575' (south) and 3.05 miles : 10,600' (north). The south lake is narrow and hemmed by steep walls and timber; in contrast the north lake is large and accessible. Social tracks circle the lake to wide views of the basin and good lakeside campsites. The outlets of each lower lake can be traced east to a third Crater Lake hidden from the main trail. To reach it, backtrack on the main trail to the aforementioned trail sign and follow the stream a few hundred yards east. There are also several social trails in the area leading to this lake. No maintained trail leads to upper Crater Lakes, however you can follow the northern-lower lake's inlet to them. The route is very steep and may be impassible when wet or iced over. Scale the steep wall on the west end of the lower northern lake. The climb levels off at the foot of a large talus field, from which you'll see the upper lakes and a direct (albeit difficult) line to them.

The first lake occupies a marshy flat below treeline; the second, much larger lake fills a deep bowl at treeline below Rollins Pass and the Continental Divide. There are several outlying ponds that require off-trail navigation to reach. A short trail runs down from Rollins Pass Road to the upper lake, though access is limited by difficult driving conditions and occasional closures.

The trail continues north in a thinning forest on a faint, shifting path to a footbridge over the outlet of Forest Lake #1 (3.15 miles : 10,664'). It follows the stream through a marsh to the south shore of Forest Lake #1 (3.25 miles). Most of the lake is accessible - the south and east sides shaded while the north is an open meadow. The lake is relatively small and easy for anglers to circle. Contrary to some map depictions the main trail continues up the west side of Forest Lake #1. It rises then drops to wooden planks over a marshy inlet (3.4 miles), then turns sharply uphill on a rugged path. The narrow, uneven trail negotiates minor obstacles and a small talus field (3.55 miles : 10,767') while veering away from the stream to its apogee (3.8 miles : 10,883').

The split is not marked but the path is very clear. If not, look uphill for guideposts. The Rogers Pass Trail climbs sharply with rangy views across the Heart - Rogers Peak lakes basin. It switchbacks several times before braiding atop the Divide. All paths intersect the Continental Divide Trail, but it's advisable to follow signs off to your left. There are two signs up here - an old dilapidated one for the pass (11,860'), and a new one with trail information (4.85 miles : 11,875').

It measures nearly .5 miles wide, .25 miles long, covers approximately 60 acres, and is an estimated 200' thick in its accumulation zone. Because it's still moving, geologists classify it as a true glacier. Trail Map | Photo Gallery A moderate 3.95 mile trail leads from Fourth of July Trailhead to Arapaho Glacier Overlook, which spans a saddle between South Arapaho Peak and an unnamed 13,038' peak to the east. A good route continues .5 miles and 692' up to South Arapaho Peak with views across the Gore Range, Ten Mile Range, Rocky Mountain National Park and North Fork Middle Boulder Creek: The trail rises steadily past the Indian Peaks Wilderness Backcountry board (.4 miles : 10,385') to the first of several pitched switchbacks (.55 miles : 10,461'). In .8 miles the trail levels across steep, open hillsides with views across the valley of Mount Neva (12,814') and Diamond Lake's outlet waterfall. The trail narrows across the midsection of a steep waterfall (1 mile : 10,650') to the Diamond Lake - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.15 miles : 10,752'). Bear right on the Arapaho Pass Trail, which straightens on a methodical climb up the north valley wall. It rises in a thinning forest with views over the North Fork of Middle Boulder Creek, a lush valley braided with snow-fed streams and ponds. The trail relaxes through a krummholz flat (1.65 miles : 11,110') to the Arapaho Glacier Trail split (2.05 miles : 11,236'). Bear right and cross the creek. The trail narrows and twists through dense willow and krummholz that may obscure the path. Once through treeline it straightens, steepens, and clarifies on a northeast heading into the open alpine.  The trail bends NW below the summit of S. Arapaho Peak on the final run up to the glacier overlook. Arapaho Glacier Overlook (3.95 miles : 12,705') stands nearly 500' above the glacier's base. Two large tarns and a string of lakes - all part of the Boulder Watershed - form from the glacier's ablation zone. If not summiting South Arapaho Peak, consider a short distance up the eastern saddle for wider views of the glacier. The Arapaho Glacier Trail bends east from the Overlook and drops back to its terminus at the Glacier Rim Trailhead at Rainbow Lakes Campground. To reach South Arapaho Peak, continue west on a social trail toward the summit. The trail soon loses clarity amid the talus, but rock cairns and an intuitive heading will keep you on track. The trail clears 13,000' at 4.2 miles and moderates over false summits on a free scramble to South Arapaho Peak (4.5 miles : 13,397'). Two rock wind shelters and a peak finder are on the summit.

The Arapaho Pass Trail continues west on a methodical climb up the north valley wall. The valley below is noteworthy, highlighted by a network of glacier-fed streams and ponds. The trail moderates through a broad krummholz flat (1.65 miles : 11,110') to the Arapaho Glacier Trail split (2.05 miles : 11,236'), and continues past the historic Fourth of July Mine into open tundra. The trail is well-defined but markedly rugged once above treeline. In 3 miles the ramp-like trail curls toward the valley-center and Caribou Pass - Arapaho Pass Trail split on a saddle atop the Continental Divide (3.15 miles : 11,906'). Bear right on the Arapaho Pass Trail, which turns north up the saddle with great views down the west side of the Divide, and the steep, winding course you'll take to Caribou Lake. The trails crests at 3.4 miles (11,953') and turns sharply down narrowly-cut switchbacks to the rolling basin floor (4.15 miles : 11,342'). Once down it moderates on a fairly direct line to the lake. Though you may no longer see the lake, its location is fairly intuitive. The trail forks at an unmarked split (4.45 miles) and veers left to Caribou Lake (4.65 miles : 11,267'). Caribou's shore is open and easy to explore. Honor re-vegetation efforts and avoid travel in these marked areas. Social trails lead west to a large tarn above Caribou Lake in the valley's SW corner.

Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	Visitors will enjoy stunning alpine scenery and light crowds much of the way. The segment between the Devils Thumb Trail and Diamond Lake is exposed and steep with some potentially vague stretches. Allow extra time for the return, which requires a demanding climb back over treeline:  The trail begins on a steep dirt road lined with aspen and wildflowers, merging with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). Bear right on the Devils Thumb Bypass Trail. 	Moderately steep switchbacks twist through dense forest to a broad meadow ringed by aspen and braided with streams (1.25 miles : 9,625'). This is a good place to find wildlife. 	The trail levels past the Wilderness Boundary (1.4 miles : 9,650') back into the forest (1.65 miles). 	A moderate, rocky path climbs through intervals of meadow and forest to the Devils Thumb Trail - Woodland Lake Trail split (2.2 miles, 9,792'). Veer right toward Jasper Lake on a steeper grade that can be obscured by runoff and snow through early summer. 	Be patient with route finding and ignore social trails that ostensibly offer an easier way. Anticipate one sudden, poorly marked left turn over a tributary at 2.85 miles (10,215'). 	The trail climbs methodically to the Diamond Lake Trail split (3.75 miles : 10,675'), which bends northeast on a winding, strenuous push through treeline. A thinning forest yields sweeping views and useful perspective on the valley through which you've passed. These high open slopes are a good place to see elk in peak summer months. 	The trail negotiates a final band of spruce (4.25 miles : 11,095') before clearing treeline (4.35 miles : 11,135'); once through it fades with only a series of large, spaced-out cairns for guidance. The trail gradually curls N-NW with terrific views of the Diamond Lake valley. 	The trail eases to its high-point (4.65 miles : 11,510') and a divisive saddle between the valleys (5.0 : 11,450'). Here it drops steeply north on rugged, ill-defined switchbacks. Remain vigilant on this descent. 	The trail enters a reconstituting forest (5.4 miles : 11,020'), bends northwest and begins a shifting, undulating course to the lake. It crosses a marsh on wooden planks (5.55 miles : 10,980') and continues unevenly in a pristine forest. 	Small glades and the sound of rushing water mark the final approach - follows signs across the outlet stream (6.15 miles : 10,930') to Diamond Lake (6.22 miles : 10,940'). 	Diamond Lake occupies a large, flat basin near treeline. Follow campsite access trails around Diamond Lake to views across the basin and Continental Divide, or up the north shore to its inlet, which you may follow on a x-country route to Upper Diamond Lake. 	While most hikers access Diamond Lake from the Fourth of July Trailhead, a longer and commensurately rewarding alternative begins at the Hessie Trailhead.

Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The trail continues .35 miles above King Lake to the Continental Divide, where it joins the High Lonesome Trail near Rollins Pass in the open tundra. Those with time can access Betty Lake and Bob Lake from a .5 mile spur off the main trail: 	The trail begins on a steep dirt road that merges with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). 	It continues beside the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and eases into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600').  The trail enters a mixed pine forest and climbs steadily for the better part of 2.5 miles with little variation up the south flank of Woodland Mountain. A dense forest limits views but never fully envelops the trail. The South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek is audible much of the way, but its location remains elusive through the timber. 	Travel relaxes in a meadow below Guinn Mountain (3.85 miles : 10,437'), past which the creek and trail merge in a thinning forest. 	The trail abruptly banks right up a steep ridge on switchbacks (4.75 miles : 10,904') that level off near treeline at the King Lake - Betty and Bob Lakes Trail split (5.0 miles : 11,108'). Cross left over the creek, which flows heavily during runoff and may obscure the way. 	The trail rises quickly in a transitional alpine landscape with abundant wildflowers and rangy views back down valley. The trail is well-cut, but may be overgrown or snow-covered in places. 	Anticipate an unmarked spur that veers right to a small, partially hidden lake just before reaching King Lake (5.25 miles : 11,339'); those with time should explore this attractive area. 	A few minutes ahead another unmarked spur branches right (5.38 miles) - this is King Lake (5.4 miles : 11,430').

168,Skyscraper Reservoir ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,9.9,9009,11220,2211,Moderate,Yes,"  Skyscraper Reservoir lies in the upper reaches of a slender valley between Woodland Mountain (11,893' - south) and unofficially named Skyscraper Peak (12,383' - north). The reservoir - no longer maintained but still partially dammed - was built between 1941 and 1947 by private landowners for downstream irrigation and sold to the City of Boulder in 1966.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  Visitors will enjoy excellent wildlife viewing, camping, and fishing on this varied trek through riparian woodlands, alpine meadows, and open tundra between Woodland Lake and Skyscraper Reservoir: 	The trail begins on a steep dirt road that merges with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). 	It continues beside the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and eases into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600'). 	The trail enters a large meadow on level double track across the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (1.45 : 9,611'). It follows the old wagon road through intervals of forest and meadow, first loosely, then closely beside Jasper Creek to the Devils Thumb Trail - Woodland Lake Trail split (2.35 miles : 9,747'). Note that social trails circumvent washed out areas along Jasper Creek up to this split. 	The Woodland Lake Trail bears left and steepens beside Woodland Creek to a footbridge (2.8 miles : 10,022'), past which the climb intensifies on a rugged, shifting path. It moderates briefly in a tranquil forest braided with streams and dotted with glades (3.2 miles : 10,395'). 	The oft-wet trail inches back toward Woodland Creek, rising fast to another flat (3.5 miles : 10,609'). This attractive section is highlighted by converging streams, cascades, wildflowers and mushrooms. Travel eases on an intermittently faint path, edging away from the creek to a small pond (3.8 miles : 10,737') and up the north edge of a marshy meadow in the upper valley. 	The trail enters a small spruce stand on the meadow's west end (4.0 miles) and emerges in open space at the base of Woodland Lake's outlet stream (4.3 miles). It levels beside the outlet to Woodland Lake, partially hidden a few dozen yards off trail by thick willow and krummholz (4.55 miles : 10,972'). 	The trail rises steadily up the north shore and valley wall with good views of Woodland Lake's attractive west shore. The trail crests at 4.9 miles (11,243') and drops to a clearing on the NE corner of Skyscraper Reservoir (4.95 miles : 11,220'). 	The lake's north side is limited by steep walls, talus and vegetation, but low water over the dam wall and some creative maneuvering lead to the more open south and west shores.  Skyscraper Reservoir lies in the upper reaches of a slender valley between Woodland Mountain (11,893' - south) and unofficially named Skyscraper Peak (12,383' - north). The reservoir - no longer maintained but still partially dammed - was built between 1941 and 1947 by private landowners for downstream irrigation and sold to the City of Boulder in 1966. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Visitors will enjoy excellent wildlife viewing, camping, and fishing on this varied trek through riparian woodlands, alpine meadows, and open tundra between Woodland Lake and Skyscraper Reservoir:	The trail begins on a steep dirt road that merges with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455').	It continues beside the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and eases into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600').	The trail enters a large meadow on level double track across the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (1.45 : 9,611'). It follows the old wagon road through intervals of forest and meadow, first loosely, then closely beside Jasper Creek to the Devils Thumb Trail - Woodland Lake Trail split (2.35 miles : 9,747'). Note that social trails circumvent washed out areas along Jasper Creek up to this split.	The Woodland Lake Trail bears left and steepens beside Woodland Creek to a footbridge (2.8 miles : 10,022'), past which the climb intensifies on a rugged, shifting path.

This attractive section is highlighted by converging streams, cascades, wildflowers and mushrooms. Travel eases on an intermittently faint path, edging away from the creek to a small pond (3.8 miles : 10,737') and up the north edge of a marshy meadow in the upper valley.	The trail enters a small spruce stand on the meadow's west end (4.0 miles) and emerges in open space at the base of Woodland Lake's outlet stream (4.3 miles). It levels beside the outlet to Woodland Lake, partially hidden a few dozen yards off trail by thick willow and krummholz (4.55 miles : 10,972').	The trail rises steadily up the north shore and valley wall with good views of Woodland Lake's attractive west shore. The trail crests at 4.9 miles (11,243') and drops to a clearing on the NE corner of Skyscraper Reservoir (4.95 miles : 11,220').	The lake's north side is limited by steep walls, talus and vegetation, but low water over the dam wall and some creative maneuvering lead to the more open south and west shores.",39.951666666667,-105.594933333333,76.28333333333333
169,Woodland Lake ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,9.1,9009,10972,1963,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," Woodland Lake is located 4.55 miles from Hessie Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. It lies at treeline in a narrow valley that drains into Jasper Creek. It covers 6 acres at a maximum depth of 7', with nice openings on the west side ideal for camping and fishing. Woodland Lake sees lighter traffic than other destinations in this travel zone, a good choice during peak summer months. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail begins on a steep dirt road lined with aspen and wildflowers, merging with the South Fork of Middle Boulder Creek at the King Lake - Devils Thumb Bypass Trail split (.85 miles : 9,455'). The trail rises along the creek to the Lost Lake Trail split (1.1 miles : 9,582') and eases into a meadow at the King Lake - Woodland Lake Trail split (1.3 miles : 9,600'). The trail enters a large meadow on level double track across the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (1.45 : 9,611').

Note that social trails circumvent washed out areas along Jasper Creek up to this split. The Woodland Lake Trail bears left and steepens up Woodland Creek to a footbridge (2.8 miles : 10,022'), past which the climb intensifies on a rugged, shifting path. It moderates briefly in a tranquil forest braided with streams and dotted with glades (3.2 miles : 10,395'). This is a good place to see deer, elk, bear and grouse. The oft-wet trail inches back toward Woodland Creek, rising fast to another flat (3.5 miles : 10,609'). This attractive section is highlighted by converging streams, cascades, wildflowers and mushrooms. Travel eases on an intermittently faint path, edging away from the creek to a small pond (3.8 miles : 10,737') and up the north edge of a marshy meadow in the upper valley. The trail enters a small spruce stand on the meadow's west end (4.0 miles) and emerges in open space at the base of Woodland Lake's outlet stream (4.3 miles). It levels beside the outlet to Woodland Lake, partially hidden a few dozen yards off trail by thick willow and krummholz (4.55 miles : 10,972'). Access and views are limited from its north shore, but crossing the narrow outlet to its southeast shore leads to grassy slopes and arguably the vicinity's best views.

170,Gibraltar Lakes ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,9.5,9655,11181,1526,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," 	The Gibraltar Lakes lie at the base of St Vrain Glaciers near the Indian Peaks - Rocky Mountain National Park boundary. This trio forms the headwaters of Middle St Vrain Creek at the top of a spectacular alpine valley.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The following description begins at the Middle St Vrain 4WD Road terminus, 3.75 miles west of Camp Dick. Only experienced drivers with adequate clearance can complete this drive; others may either walk the road or equidistant Buchanan Pass Trail from the Middle St Vrain Trailhead at Camp Dick. Plan travel time accordingly and call ahead for road conditions:  The Buchanan Pass Trail crosses Middle St Vrain Creek and bends NW through a diminutive spruce flat. It rises nominally along the creek with views of Sawtooth Mountain to the St Vrain Mountain Trail split (.7 miles : 9,832'), and continues NW in a taller forest. 	Timber breaks at a large clearing, a good place to camp and look for elk and moose (1.45 miles : 9,925'). The Buchannan Pass - St Vrain Glacier Trail split is located on the far side of this meadow (1.6 miles : 9,947'); keep right on the St Vrain Glacier Trail. 	The St Vrain Glacier Trail climbs steadily beside the creek in a healthy spruce-fir forest that opens across a short talus field (2.7 miles) to the first of several stream crossings (2.75 miles : 10,320'). 	Mild travel resumes south of the creek to a second (unaided) crossing over a wide but shallow section (3.05 miles : 10,412'). Once across the trail rises gently to a scenic meadow and cluster of four large ponds (3.45 miles : 10,552'). 	It crosses the creek (south) once again, this time on a log jam at the outlet of the first pond you come to. It continues past this marshy complex in a thinning forest with expanding views of the upper valley. 	The trail climbs steadily to the first break in treeline (4.1 miles : 10,790') and loses clarity amid thick willow, krummholz, lingering snow and talus. 	It negotiates rugged undulations to the confluence of Middle St Vrain Creek and Gibraltar Lakes' outlet stream (4.4 miles : 10,910'). Veer left (south) up a steep slope cut by the outlet. 	The path can be difficult to follow, but generally traces the outlet stream to the lakes. If off course, stay close to the water and aim for glaciers on the south valley wall - the lakes are located at their base (note: a small lake to the west is a nice side trip, but not your destination). 	The Gibraltar Lakes' outlet braids a wide slope carpeted by flowers. Though some maps show a clear path east of this outlet to the largest lake, it's actually quite faint and leads unnecessarily through talus. 	Take the path of least resistance beside the outlet to the first Gibraltar Lake (4.75 miles : 11,181').

173,Cascade Falls ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,9.2,8345,9207,862,Moderate,Yes,"  Cascade Falls are accessible from the Monarch Lake Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area on the west side of the Continental Divide. Cascade Falls are comprised of 4 separate waterfalls spanning a .7 mile stretch of Cascade Creek, 4.6 miles from the trailhead.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  A relatively mild trail follows Monarch Lake, Buchanan Creek, and Cascade Creek through mixed forests to the main falls complex, passing several other notable but unnamed falls along the way. Visitors will enjoy good trail conditions, ideal backcountry camping terrain, and diverse wildlife on the hike to Cascade Falls: 	The trail begins on a level path up the north shore of Monarch Lake. It moves quickly to the lake's marshy inlet (.95 miles) and enters a mixed forest at the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (1.25 miles : 8,358'). It rises to the Cascade Creek Trail - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.6 miles : 8,367') and steepens under a tall canopy badly marred by beetle kill. 	At 2.05 miles (8,481') the trail merges with Buchanan Creek before climbing away on steep switchbacks. It moderates past 2.5 miles and begins a long, level stretch through uniform columns of lodgepole to the Buchanan Pass Trail split (3.45 miles : 8,772'). 	Backcountry camping terrain is notably good on this flat segment, and well-spaced trees provide good viewing lanes for wildlife. Look for deer, moose, and bear along this verdant stretch. 	The trail continues over a bridge near the confluence off Buchanan Creek and Cascade Creek (3.6 miles : 8,835') and climbs to a narrow, forceful waterfall (3.75 miles). This is not Cascade Falls, but one of several unnamed ones en route to the main group. 	The trail rises to a long bridge at an abrupt opening in the valley (4.4 miles : 9,106'), where it crosses Cascade Creek to the first of four main falls that comprise Cascade Falls (4.6 miles : 9,207'). Note that fires and horses are not permitted beyond the bridge leading to the falls. 	The grade steepens considerably beside the falls, each accessible by a short spur.

The lakes are .2 miles apart in a deep bowl carved from Mount Achonee (12,469') and Lone Eagle Peak (11,920') on the west side of the Continental Divide.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The Cascade Creek Trail follows Monarch Lake, Buchanan Creek, and Cascade Creek for 7.4 miles to the lakes. While achievable in a day, numerous highlights and backcountry camping options warrant an overnight stay. Visitors will enjoy miles of fishable streams, Cascade Falls and abundant wildflowers on the hike to Crater Lake:  The Cascade Creek Trail begins on a level path up the north shore of Monarch Lake to the Indian Peaks boundary (1.2 miles : 8,358'). Look for osprey over the lake, moose in the marshy inlet area and raspberries along the way. 	It rises to the Cascade Creek Trail - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.6 miles : 8,367') and steepens under a tall canopy marred by beetle kill. 	At 2.05 miles (8,481') the trail merges with Buchanan Creek before climbing away on steep switchbacks. It moderates past 2.5 miles and begins a long, level stretch through uniform lodgepole to the Buchanan Pass Trail split (3.45 miles : 8,772'). 	Camping terrain is particularly good on this flat, verdant segment. 	The trail continues over a bridge near the confluence off Buchanan Creek and Cascade Creek (3.6 miles : 8,835') and climbs to a narrow, voluminous waterfall (3.75 miles). This is not Cascade Falls, but one of several unnamed ones en route to the main group. 	The trail rises to a long bridge at an abrupt opening in the valley (4.4 miles : 9,106'), where it crosses Cascade Creek to the first of four main falls that comprise Cascade Falls (4.55 miles : 9,207'). Note that fires and horses are not permitted beyond the bridge leading to the falls. 	Travel steepens beside the falls, each accessible by a short spur. The trail passes the top of the fourth fall and grows rugged beyond this point (5.2 miles : 9,525'). 	The forest breaks on the edge of a large meadow, one of the best places to see moose, elk and bear on this trail (5.4 miles : 9,670'). 	Steep climbing resumes past the meadow into a fragmented subalpine forest with expanding views of the upper valley. The trail crosses a narrow, elevated bridge over a major tributary that may be tricky when wet, or carrying large packs (6.45 miles : 9,995'). 	Veer right at the Pawnee Pass Trail split (6.65 miles : 10,033') and look for cairns leading over open rock slabs to backcountry campsite #1 (6.85 miles : 10,153'). 	Just ahead the trail crosses Cascade Creek on a makeshift bridge, 50 yards past an old bridge washed out in recent years by heavy runoff (6.95 miles : 10,153'). It's important to locate the trail over the creek before crossing. 	Once over, find the main trail and continue through an idyllic subalpine setting of tall glades, small meadows, braided streams, and brilliant wildflowers. This is arguably the prettiest section of the hike. 	The trail makes one final push up steep, shifting switchbacks to Mirror Lake (7.2 miles : 10,291'). Lone Eagle Peak looms over Mirror Lake, one of the most iconic settings in the Indian Peaks Wilderness.

Crater Lake and Mirror Lake are accessible from Monarch Lake Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. The lakes are .2 miles apart in a deep bowl carved from Mount Achonee (12,469') and Lone Eagle Peak (11,920') on the west side of the Continental Divide. Trail Map | Photo Gallery	The Cascade Creek Trail follows Monarch Lake, Buchanan Creek, and Cascade Creek for 7.4 miles to the lakes. While achievable in a day, numerous highlights and backcountry camping options warrant an overnight stay. Visitors will enjoy miles of fishable streams, Cascade Falls and abundant wildflowers on the hike to Crater Lake: The Cascade Creek Trail begins on a level path up the north shore of Monarch Lake to the Indian Peaks boundary (1.2 miles : 8,358'). Look for osprey over the lake, moose in the marshy inlet area and raspberries along the way.	It rises to the Cascade Creek Trail - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.6 miles : 8,367') and steepens under a tall canopy marred by beetle kill.	At 2.05 miles (8,481') the trail merges with Buchanan Creek before climbing away on steep switchbacks. It moderates past 2.5 miles and begins a long, level stretch through uniform lodgepole to the Buchanan Pass Trail split (3.45 miles : 8,772').	Camping terrain is particularly good on this flat, verdant segment.	The trail continues over a bridge near the confluence off Buchanan Creek and Cascade Creek (3.6 miles : 8,835') and climbs to a narrow, voluminous waterfall (3.75 miles). This is not Cascade Falls, but one of several unnamed ones en route to the main group.	The trail rises to a long bridge at an abrupt opening in the valley (4.4 miles : 9,106'), where it crosses Cascade Creek to the first of four main falls that comprise Cascade Falls (4.55 miles : 9,207'). Note that fires and horses are not permitted beyond the bridge leading to the falls.	Travel steepens beside the falls, each accessible by a short spur. The trail passes the top of the fourth fall and grows rugged beyond this point (5.2 miles : 9,525').	The forest breaks on the edge of a large meadow, one of the best places to see moose, elk and bear on this trail (5.4 miles : 9,670').	Steep climbing resumes past the meadow into a fragmented subalpine forest with expanding views of the upper valley. The trail crosses a narrow, elevated bridge over a major tributary that may be tricky when wet, or carrying large packs (6.45 miles : 9,995').	Veer right at the Pawnee Pass Trail split (6.65 miles : 10,033') and look for cairns leading over open rock slabs to backcountry campsite #1 (6.85 miles : 10,153').	Just ahead the trail crosses Cascade Creek on a makeshift bridge, 50 yards past an old bridge washed out in recent years by heavy runoff (6.95 miles : 10,153'). It's important to locate the trail over the creek before crossing.	Once over, find the main trail and continue through an idyllic subalpine setting of tall glades, small meadows, braided streams, and brilliant wildflowers. This is arguably the prettiest section of the hike.	The trail makes one final push up steep, shifting switchbacks to Mirror Lake (7.2 miles : 10,291'). Lone Eagle Peak looms over Mirror Lake, one of the most iconic settings in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. A number of designated campsites ring the small lake.	The main trail continues in a thinning forest up the west shore of Mirror Lake to Crater Lake (7.4 miles : 10,327').

It lies just below treeline in a large, granite bowl west of the Continental Divide. Gourd Lake is similar in appearance to nearby Mirror Lake but with lighter crowds. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Though fairly long, moderate conditions make Gourd Lake achievable in a day with 2.7 miles of steady switchbacks between Cascade Creek and the lake to mitigate steep grades. Visitors will enjoy diverse terrain, berry picking and excellent fishing at Gourd Lake: The Cascade Creek Trail begins on a level path up the north shore of Monarch Lake to the Indian Peaks boundary (1.2 miles : 8,358'). Look for osprey over the lake, moose in the marshy inlet area and raspberries along the way. The trail rises to the Cascade Creek Trail - Arapaho Pass Trail split (1.6 miles : 8,361') and steepens under a tall canopy badly marred by pine beetles. It briefly merges with Buchanan Creek (2.05 miles : 8,481') before climbing away on switchbacks. Grades level past 2.5 miles to the Buchanan Pass Trail split (3.45 miles : 8,772'). The Buchanan Pass Trail pitches up and NE along Buchanan Creek in a more open forest. It moderates through 4.0 miles (9,110') past a few clearings and aspen groves. While the forest is aesthetically mundane, this versatile habitat supports a range of wildlife. The trail crosses a tributary at 4.75 miles; there's a bridge for hikers but you may choose to hop the stream in favor of this aging plank. Travel steadies to the Gourd Lake Trail split (6.0 miles : 9,583'), where you'll begin a 2.7 mile segment of long-leg switchbacks up to the lake. Despite their uninviting depiction on a topo map, these switchbacks are relatively moderate over even terrain. Lodgepole is gradually phased out from 7 - 7.5 miles on the transition to a healthier spruce-fir forest. Thinning timber and higher elevations expose ridgelines of the Divide, Cascade Creek corridor and Crater Lake cirque. Conditions grow rugged leading to a scenic pond in the upper valley (8.0 miles : 10,762'). The trail skirts it to a second pond, which is actually just a long finger of Gourd Lake's outlet channel. Here the trail loses clarity; some maps show it doubling back on itself and heading up the left side, but it's equally easy to follow the right side up to Gourd Lake (8.3 miles : 10,795'). Steep granite walls frame much of the lake and limit exploration, however social trails around the open south shore connect natural jetties that provide unique vantages and fishing access.

178,Stone Lake ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,12.3,8320,10643,2323,Strenuous,Yes," Stone Lake is located 6.15 miles from Roaring Fork Trailhead in the Indian Peaks Wilderness. This challenging hike begins at Lake Granby and follows the Roaring Fork drainage up to Irving Hale Pass. It rolls through airy meadows before diving steeply into Hell Canyon and rising back to Stone Lake. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Upper Stone Lake is located .4 miles ahead at the top of Hell Canyon between Hiamovi Mountain (12,395') and Cooper Peak (12,296'). The lakes are aptly named for large rock features that form the basin, though the lakes themselves are surrounded by gentle terrain ideal for camping and exploration. Stone Lake sees less traffic than nearby Mirror, Crater and Gourd lakes, primarily for the degree of difficulty. The Stone Lakes compare favorably to each, with greater diversity along the way: The trail runs level around Pete's Cove to the IPW Boundary (.18 miles), past which it climbs 810' in just .8 miles to a bridge across the Roaring Fork (1.0 miles : 9,172'). Enjoy views of Lake Granby and a colorful mix of aspen and thimbleberries on this challenging segment. Travel eases up the north side of the creek in a mixed forest marred by pine beetles (1.5 miles : 9,295'). Despite extensive damage, the herbaceous layer is healthy and diversely vegetated. The trail rises in short spurts to bridges at 2.35 miles and 2.58 miles into a damp clearing at the Lake Watanga Trail split (2.65 miles : 9,805'). There's good camping in this area, and the last level terrain before reaching the pass. The Roaring Fork Trail splits right up the south valley wall on a steady, leg-burning climb in a healthier forest. This shaded north-facing slope can hold snow well into June and make travel difficult, especially with heavy packs. Grades finally moderate across the first of several large glades (3.7 miles : 10,855') that open to airy meadows on Mount Irving Hale Pass (4.1 miles : 11,195'). This is a great place to camp, explore and look for wildlife - particularly elk. It's also a fine turnaround point if not aiming for the lakes. Mount Irving Hale (11,754') stands prominently above, which can be scaled for rangy views over the meadows and Hell Canyon. Berry patches cover the area, and peak in late September. The trail rolls through open space to cabin remains on the far end (4.75 miles : 11,095'), where it begins a steep and shifting descent down the north wall of Hell Canyon. It loses clarity in places, which can be exacerbated by snow. Views of Crawford Lake and Long Lake briefly emerge in Hell Canyon before losing sight amid rugged terrain. The trail gradually levels into a meadow in the upper valley, again vague in places but now with a clear heading (5.5 miles : 10,595'). It dips across before rising gently back in a thin forest to the north side of Stone Lake (6.15 miles : 10,643'). The lake opens to grassy shorelines, rocky outcrops and elevated terraces with great views and places to camp. Rock jetties extend far into the lake, offering unique access for anglers. The trail fades but easily follows the inlet stream through treeline to Upper Stone Lake (6.55 miles : 10,736'). Upper Stone Lake is surrounded by large, level meadows and a few tree-topped knolls. Hiamovi Mountain's distinct summit looms above, with an easily reached saddle near the Rocky Mountain National Park boundary.

181,St Vrain Mountain ,indian-peaks-wilderness-area-james-peak-wilderness-area,8.9,8940,12162,3222,Strenuous,Yes," St Vrain Mountain (12,162') straddles the border between the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area (south) and Rocky Mountain National Park (north). It stands just east of the Continental Divide with rangy views across the Middle St Vrain Creek drainage and Wild Basin Area of RMNP. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail scales a steep gulch to treeline, then moderates across broad tundra saddles and ridges to the base of the summit, where an access route splits off and climbs 800' in just .8 miles to the top: The trail climbs steadily up the valley's north side through lodgepole and aspen to the Indian Peaks Wilderness Boundary (.7 miles : 9,332'), and a swath of diminutive, sparsely plotted limber pine (1.0 miles : 9,650'). The trail switchbacks hard left (west) one final time (1.5 miles : 10,008') before turning sharply south across the valley with perspective on the route you've taken to this point (1.75 miles : 10,215'). Grades briefly moderate at 2.1 miles (10,405'), then steepen back up the south valley wall. The trail twists steeply through uniformly tall spruce (a counter-intuitive contrast to the forest below), turning sharply south one last time before clearing treeline (2.65 miles : 10,765'). Travel eases along a broad tundra saddle between the triangulated shoulders of Meadow Mountain (11,632'), an unnamed peak, and St Vrain Mountain. It reaches the Rocky Mountain National Park Boundary (3.15 miles : 11,180') and levels for nearly half a mile on a south heading with some of the route's best views. This airy section overlooks Rocky Mountain's Wild Basin Area, Mount Copeland (13,176'), Ouzel Peak (12, 12,716'), Mahana Peak (12,632'), Longs Peak (14,259') and Mt Meeker (13,911'). Those not aiming for the summit will be content with views along this stretch. The trail exits Rocky Mountain National Park (3.6 miles : 11,335') and threads a few pockets of krummholz to an unmarked turnoff for St Vrain Mountain. A trio of unassuming cairns are all that initially guide you off the main trail toward the summit; remain vigilant and anticipate this point - more navigational help awaits up-slope. Leave the main trail (3.65 miles : 11,360') and aim for a band of krummholz approximately 200 yards away.

The Bear Lake Nature Loop is an ideal family destination for its accessibility, short length, and ecological diversity. The loop trail begins just beyond the Bear Lake Ranger Station and should be hiked counter-clockwise to coincide with an interpretive guide available at the trailhead for a dollar or so. The interpretive guide is the key to 30 marked spots along the trail which tell the story of the Bear Lake Area. How is a glacier formed? What is that huge snow-capped peak to the east? When was this land last inhabited and by whom? Do black bears live at Bear Lake? The interpretive guide answers these questions and many more. It is highly recommended to purchase this brochure to enhance your experience while at Bear Lake.  The trail itself simply encircles Bear Lake, a beautiful body of water which rests in a rock basin in the middle of a healthy pine, fir and spruce forest. Take time to relax on one of several wood benches, enjoy the view and allow about one hour to complete the loop. ",,,

It fills a shallow depression at treeline beneath Flattop Mountain (12,324'), Ptarmigan Point (12,363') and Notchtop Mountain (12,129'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery This moderate-grade trail runs through subalpine forests to the basin, and continues around Joe Mills Mountain to Lake Odessa. Two Rivers Lake - a larger body with comparable aesthetics - is hidden just off trail and downstream from Lake Helene: The trail rises quickly over Bear Lake through young aspen to the Odessa Lake - Mill Creek Basin split (.45 miles : 9,725'). Follow signs to Odessa Lake. It continues steadily to the Flattop Mountain Trail split (1.0 mile : 9,965'), past which grades steepen up a rocky path. The forest opens across a short but steep-sloping scree field (2.3 miles : 10,436') where poles or traction are helpful when snow-covered. Travel moderates to the Sourdough Campsite (2.65 miles : 10,585'), crests (10,692') and drops to several unmarked spurs on your left for Lake Helene (3.0 miles : 10,620'). Each weaves through dense krummholz to the northeast shore of Lake Helene (3.15 miles : 10,643'). Note the lake is partially concealed from the trail and spurs are fairly easy to miss. If you make a sharp hairpin turn north (right) and begin descending, you've gone too far. Lake Helene is fed by the snow-lined slopes of Flattop Mountain (12,324'), Ptarmigan Point (12,363') and Notchtop Mountain (12,129'). Social trails circle the lake to more private areas, but the best views of Lake Helene come from its open (and busy) northeast shore. The main trail continues around and down the north flank of Joe Mills Mountain (11,078') for 1.15 miles to Odessa Lake (4.3 miles : 10,055'). Two Rivers Lake Two Rivers Lake fills a shallow flat just downstream from Lake Helene. It sees much less traffic because it's unmarked and partially hidden from the main trail by thick forest and rugged talus. From the Sourdough Campsite (2.68 miles : 10,628'), begin looking through the trees and across the valley. Two Rivers Lake is .15 miles from this section of trail in the valley-center.  Unless you can see the lake and a direct line to it (or Marigold Pond along its outlet), simply drop into the boulders and scramble down into the basin; a little intuitive navigation will lead right to it. Lake Helene is located 3.15 miles from Bear Lake Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park. It fills a shallow depression at treeline beneath Flattop Mountain (12,324'), Ptarmigan Point (12,363') and Notchtop Mountain (12,129').Trail Map | Photo GalleryThis moderate-grade trail runs through subalpine forests to the basin, and continues around Joe Mills Mountain to Lake Odessa. Two Rivers Lake - a larger body with comparable aesthetics - is hidden just off trail and downstream from Lake Helene:The trail rises quickly over Bear Lake through young aspen to the Odessa Lake - Mill Creek Basin split (.45 miles : 9,725'). Follow signs to Odessa Lake.It continues steadily to the Flattop Mountain Trail split (1.0 mile : 9,965'), past which grades steepen up a rocky path. The forest opens across a short but steep-sloping scree field (2.3 miles : 10,436') where poles or traction are helpful when snow-covered.Travel moderates to the Sourdough Campsite (2.65 miles : 10,585'), crests (10,692') and drops to several unmarked spurs on your left for Lake Helene (3.0 miles : 10,620').Each weaves through dense krummholz to the northeast shore of Lake Helene (3.15 miles : 10,643'). Note the lake is partially concealed from the trail and spurs are fairly easy to miss. If you make a sharp hairpin turn north (right) and begin descending, you've gone too far.Lake Helene is fed by the snow-lined slopes of Flattop Mountain (12,324'), Ptarmigan Point (12,363') and Notchtop Mountain (12,129').Social trails circle the lake to more private areas, but the best views of Lake Helene come from its open (and busy) northeast shore.

Trail Map | Photo Gallery Bierstadt Lake fills a shallow depression in a lateral moraine north of Bear Lake Road. A moderately steep climb on well-crafted switchbacks pass through open hillsides to a heavily wooded moraine-top and Bierstadt Lake. A one mile loop continues around the lake with numerous access points and post-card panoramas of the Continental Divide. The Bierstadt Lake Trail is well-suited for families, runners, and winter recreation: The trail climbs methodically on long-leg switchbacks through open hillsides of sage, grasses, and wildflowers. Aspen line portions of the trail, with much thicker stands on its fringes. Rangy views extend from Longs Peak (south) to Thatchtop Mountain (north) before leveling off in a thick lodgepole forest (.97 miles : 9,451'). Here it drops gently to the Bierstadt Lake Loop Trail junctionon the lake's southwest corner (1.05 miles : 9,438'), which continues for one mile around the lake basin through lodgepole, spruce, and fir. This upper-montane forest is arguably the Park's most biologically diverse, a food-rich ecosystem that attracts deer, elk, bear, fox, snowshoe hare among many others. Travel around Bierstadt Lake is mild and well-maintained, with numerous marked and unmarked spurs leading to its damp, sedge-lined shore. The lake's east end provides the most complete look at the Continental Divide, with standouts such as Otis Peak (12,486'), Hallet Peak (12,713'), Flattop Mountain (12,324'), Ptarmigan Point (12,363') and Notchtop Mountain (12,129').

The Bowen-Baker Trailhead is located within the Park, but the trail to Parika Lake quickly crosses the boundary.   Despite its inhospitable name, the Never Summer Wilderness features exceptional bio-diversity and some of the best alpine scenery accessible within or from Rocky Mountain National Park. Visitors will enjoy light crowds and wildlife viewing that includes elk, moose, bighorn sheep, and mountain goat: The trail begins on a mild grade in a densely wooded forest that opens and diversifies after one mile.  It steadies through pleasant but unspectacular scenery to the Grand Ditch service road at about 3.25 miles, veers left, and levels on the north side of a pretty meadow framed by peaks to the southwest. The trail reaches the Baker Gulch Trail split (3.55 miles) and begins a moderately strenuous climb into a mature spruce-fir forest. Damp clearings are a good place to find elk, moose, and abundant wildflowers. Anticipate two stream crossings that may be tricky with heavy runoff or large packs.  The trail passes a large pond at 4.25 miles (about 75 yards off the trail's right), a worthwhile detour if time permits.  Grades moderate in open tundra on the final approach to Parika Lake (5.05 miles : 11,360').  Parika Lake fills a grassy alpine flat just below Parika Peak (12,394'), Fairview Mountain (12,246') and an unnamed peak (12,253').  A well-maintained social trail circles the lake's south shore and leads to Parika Peak. Look for mountain goat and bighorn sheep on rocky slopes above the lake.

Basic route finding is necessary, especially on the return to regain the maintained trail. 	Visitors will enjoy diverse terrain, open travel and great wildlife viewing on the Chapin Creek Trail: 	The trail climbs steeply to the Chapin Creek - Mummy Range Peaks split (.12 miles : 11,175'), where it drops in a thick forest with occasional deadfall. 	Steep intervals moderate to the meadow's edge and a sign for the start of x-country travel (.8 miles : 10,588'). Note this important point, which is concealed by timber and hard to see on the return. 	Continue down the meadow and remain west of the creek, preferable for morning sun and drier slopes. Use elk and moose tracks for efficient passage through dense willow and brush. 	The trail rises over a narrow section in the valley (1.4 miles : 10,470') and drops to a wide, intermittently drier section (2.1 miles : 10,315'). Look for moose, elk, bear and even mountain lion in this open area. 	You'll cross a tributary en route to the Chapin Creek Campsite sign (2.65 miles : 10,243'), which may be off your immediate heading but visible from a distance.

194,Mount Chiquita and Ypsilon Mountain ,rocky-mountain-national-park,8.1,11040,13514,2474,Moderate-Strenuous,No," Mount Chiquita (13,069') and Ypsilon Mountain (13,514') are accessible from Chapin Pass Trailhead on Fall River Road in Rocky Mountain National Park. No trail leads to these prominent summits in the Mummy Range, but a well-established route follows contour lines and saddles to each. Mount Chiquita is considered among the easiest 13ers in the Park, and Ypsilon requires a bit more effort at higher elevation. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Their distinct east faces drop vertically and form the headwalls of massive cirques, while the west sides are relatively moderate, grassy slopes up which the route runs. Views are exceptional throughout, with western panoramas that extend from the Never Summer Range to the Medicine Bow peaks in Wyoming. Views north and east include the Desolation Peaks, Longs Peak complex and aptly named Spectacle Lakes. Mt Chapin, Chiquita and Ypsilon form the venerable CCY route. Mt Chapin (12,454') is excluded here for expediency in reaching the more distant peaks, and is arguably superfluous given its diminutive stature and proximity to Chiquita and Ypsilon. Though well-traveled, the route is vague in places and basic navigation skills are required across rugged alpine terrain. Anticipate full exposure at high altitudes, and get an early start to avoid afternoon storms: The trail climbs quickly to the split for Chapin Creek and all summits (.12 miles : 11,175'). It rises steeply in a thinning forest to unmarked Chapin Pass (.5 miles : 11,407'), then moderates to a fork and sign for All Summits (.65 miles : 11,472'). Go right. The left fork is a compelling alternative that dips across lower slopes (bypassing Mt Chapin) before rising steeply to the Chapin - Chiquita saddle. Some prefer this approach for milder terrain, but it does delay the inevitable climb, and adds more to the overall gain.  The right fork edges moderately up contour lines with long views down the Chapin Creek valley. It clears treeline (1.0 mile : 11,752') and begins rugged talus intervals at 1.3 miles. A variously clear path moves steadily to the Chapin - Chiquita saddle (1.75 miles : 12,114'). The Mt Chapin summit - right above you on this stretch - is accessible via several spurs. Travel eases momentarily on the saddle before pitching up the south flank of Chiquita. Grass gradually yields to talus, where the route braids into several viable cairn-marked paths. The way is obvious even if the trail is not. You'll see rock wind shelters around 2.6 miles leading up to the Mount Chiquita summit (2.7 miles : 13,069'). To reach Ypsilon Mountain, follow the most established track 200' down to the Chiquita - Ypsilon saddle (3.0 miles : 12,812'). A variously clear path climbs steadily up Ypsilon's south flank to a reprieve with exceptional views down couloirs to the Spectacle Lakes (3.85 miles : 13,360'). The couloirs form a distinct Y down the east face for which the mountain is named (Ypsilon is the Greek letter Y). A short, final push leads to the Ypsilon Mountain summit (4.05 miles : 13,514'). Though tempting to circumvent Chiquita on the return, consider retracing your steps back to the summit. Having some trail is more efficient than none at all in this terrain, and backtracking will limit your impact on delicate vegetation.

Mt Chapin (12,454') is excluded here for expediency in reaching the more distant peaks, and is arguably superfluous given its diminutive stature and proximity to Chiquita and Ypsilon.Though well-traveled, the route is vague in places and basic navigation skills are required across rugged alpine terrain. Anticipate full exposure at high altitudes, and get an early start to avoid afternoon storms:The trail climbs quickly to the split for Chapin Creek and all summits (.12 miles : 11,175'). It rises steeply in a thinning forest to unmarked Chapin Pass (.5 miles : 11,407'), then moderates to a fork and sign for All Summits (.65 miles : 11,472'). Go right.The left fork is a compelling alternative that dips across lower slopes (bypassing Mt Chapin) before rising steeply to the Chapin - Chiquita saddle. Some prefer this approach for milder terrain, but it does delay the inevitable climb, and adds more to the overall gain. The right fork edges moderately up contour lines with long views down the Chapin Creek valley. It clears treeline (1.0 mile : 11,752') and begins rugged talus intervals at 1.3 miles.A variously clear path moves steadily to the Chapin - Chiquita saddle (1.75 miles : 12,114'). The Mt Chapin summit - right above you on this stretch - is accessible via several spurs.Travel eases momentarily on the saddle before pitching up the south flank of Chiquita. Grass gradually yields to talus, where the route braids into several viable cairn-marked paths.The way is obvious even if the trail is not. You'll see rock wind shelters around 2.6 miles leading up to the Mount Chiquita summit (2.7 miles : 13,069'). To reach Ypsilon Mountain, follow the most established track 200' down to the Chiquita - Ypsilon saddle (3.0 miles : 12,812').A variously clear path climbs steadily up Ypsilon's south flank to a reprieve with exceptional views down couloirs to the Spectacle Lakes (3.85 miles : 13,360'). The couloirs form a distinct Y down the east face for which the mountain is named (Ypsilon is the Greek letter Y).A short, final push leads to the Ypsilon Mountain summit (4.05 miles : 13,514').Though tempting to circumvent Chiquita on the return, consider retracing your steps back to the summit. Having some trail is more efficient than none at all in this terrain, and backtracking will limit your impact on delicate vegetation.",40.434766666667,-105.730416666667,134.43333333333334
195,Mirror Lake ,rocky-mountain-national-park,12.2,10070,11015,945,Moderate,No," Mirror Lake is located 6.1 miles from the Corral Creek Trailhead in the lightly traveled northwest corner of Rocky Mountain National Park. It lies near treeline in an isolated, steep-walled N-S valley in the Mummy Range. Visitors will enjoy large open valleys, pristine forests, abundant wildlife, and miles of remote wilderness travel on the hike to Mirror Lake:  The trail begins on a flat dirt road that soon becomes trail along a lively section of Corral Creek.  It passes uneventfully through a lodgepole forest, enters Rocky Mountain National Park (1.3 miles), and breaks south into a massive valley carved by the Cache LaPoudre River.   It parallels the river for .5 miles to the Mummy Pass Trail split.  Immediately south is a vast meadow fed by Hague Creek - consider detouring through this wildlife-rich area on a .7 mile long spur used to access the Hague Creek, Desolation and Flatiron backcountry campsites.   The Mummy Pass Trail climbs steadily for .75 miles in a spruce-fir forest accented by fallen timber and thick ground cover.  It moderates for .5 miles, then pushes once more up a forested ridge to the Mirror Lake Trail split (4.3 miles : 10,700').  Turn north (left) towards Mirror Lake. The Mirror Lake Trail undulates .75 miles in a thinning subalpine forest to a meadow beside Cascade Creek.  It climbs past the north edge of the meadow to the Comanche Peak Trail split where you'll see a voluminous cascade two hundred yards shy of the lake.   The final quarter mile is highlighted by open rocky areas and abundant wildflowers. Mirror Lake (6.1 miles : 11,015') is tightly ringed by several towering, unnamed peaks.  The lake shore is somewhat cluttered, but easy enough to reach several good spots for fishing its healthy brown trout population.  You can follow an unmaintained route up the lake's east shore and inlet stream to a small pond just north of Mirror Lake.  Marked spur trails lead to several backcountry campsites in the lake vicinity. ",40.536716666667,-105.697066666667,Problems

Early risers will enjoy favorable light and a good chance of seeing deer, elk, turkey, coyote, and fox: The Cow Creek Trail heads west on a gravel road through the McGraw Ranch Research Facility into a large meadow fed by Cow Creek. It moves quickly through open space before narrowing on single track, rising incrementally toward the creek (.65 miles : 7,938'). Well-spaced aspen and ponderosa provide good wildlife viewing lanes through much of the lower valley. The trail passes through intervals of meadow and sparse timber to the Gem Lake Trail split (1.15 miles : 8,095') and Rabbit Ears Backcountry Campsite spur (1.35 miles : 8,089'). You'll reach the Bridal Veil Falls - Dark Mountain Trail split in the center of another large meadow and veer right (1.95 miles : 8,236'). The grade steepens - albeit modestly - into a busy mix of ponderosa, aspen, fir, and spruce before moderating on a damp path beside the creek. It crosses the creek twice (2.6 miles and 2.85 miles) and continues up a confining ravine to a hitchrack, past which horses are not permitted (2.9 miles : 8,614'). The trail is rugged and occasionally ill-defined as it climbs rocks slabs and stone stairs to the base of Bridal Veil Falls (3.05 miles : 8,775'). Uneven terrain, limited space, and powerful currents may initially limit views, but creative maneuvering should help find a desirable vantage (much of the year you can expect to get a bit wet). The top of Bridal Veil Falls is accessible from a social trail up its south side, where you'll find a set of smooth running cascades, interesting rock formations and terrific views of this isolated vicinity.

Deer and elk are common along these lower slopes, and southern views over Longs Peak, Beaver Meadows and Moraine Park improve with each step.Moraines separating these meadows - or low ridges of glacial till pushed aside by a glacier's downward movement - gain definition as you progress.The trail switchbacks at .85 miles with views over Horseshoe Park and the Mummy Range including Mount Chapin (12,454'), Mount Chiquita (13,069'), Ypsilon Mountain (13,514') and Fairchild Mountain (13,502').Switchbacks steepen through 1.55 miles (9,612') in a thicker mix of aspen, spruce, and fir before leveling abruptly on the ridge top (2.05 miles : 9,835').Travel eases through 2.25 miles (9,930') before dipping and climbing back to the Deer Mountain Summit Trail split (2.8 miles : 9,843'). Bear right for a short but steep climb to the summit.The Deer Mountain summit (3.0 miles : 10,013') is small but easily maneuvered for sensational panoramas that stretch across Estes Park, Longs Peak and neighboring summits on the Continental Divide, Moraine Park, Beaver Meadows, Horseshoe Park and the Mummy Range.A good map will help identify all points of interest, and provide useful perspective on the greater landscape and distance between each feature.",40.387,-105.609866666667,103.9
202,Bulwark Ridge Trail to Signal Mountain ,rocky-mountain-national-park,11.85,7817,11262,3445,Strenuous,Yes,"  Signal Mountain is located in the Comanche Peak Wilderness Area, just outside the northeastern-most corner of Rocky Mountain National Park.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	It stands over the Pennock Creek drainage with panoramas that include Mt Meeker (13,911'), Longs Peak (14,259'), South Signal Mountain (11,248') and various summits in the Stormy Peaks Range, Mummy Range, Never Summer Range and Comanche Peak Wilderness.  This challenging trail sees light traffic and is often passable by mid June. Visitors will enjoy varied terrain and lengthy stretches of open tundra en route to the summit.  Note: Though the Bulwark Trail and Signal Mountain are located in the Comanche Peak Wilderness, it's grouped here within Rocky Mountain National Park because it begins at the Dunraven Trailhead, which also accesses many destinations in the NE section of the Park: 	The Bulwark Ridge Trail begins at the north end of the Dunraven Trailhead. Follow the service road .35 miles to Trails End Ranch and signs pointing right to continue the trail. Here it begins a steep, twisting climb up a fire-scarred hillside with good views of the valley below. 	Fire-induced erosion has gullied out this challenging segment, leaving it susceptible to washouts and mud. The trail levels through a small meadow (.8 miles : 8,465') and enters an unaffected tract of pine, aspen and glades with good viewing lanes for wildlife. 	The trail moves quickly to the Miller Fork - Indian Trail junction and veers left into a thicker forest (1.3 miles : 8,717'). It rises gradually up Bulwark Ridge through uniform columns of lodgepole, becoming rocky and appreciably steeper as you progress (2.0 miles : 9,020'). 	Spruce and fir mark the transition from montane to subalpine ecosystems on this rapid climb (2.5 miles : 9,424'), an attractive composite of verdant ground cover, rocky outcrops and small clearings from blown-down trees. 	The trail climbs steeply with brief, flat intervals on the upper ridge between 3.5 and 4.5 miles. It crests in a thinning and shrinking forest atop Bulwark Ridge with navigationally useful views of the Signal Mountains (4.5 miles : 10,839'). 	It glides gently downhill and bends north up the east flank of South Signal Mountain, the path now intermittently faint and obscured by lingering snow. Large cairns provide guidance, but vigilance and a good topo map are still essential through treeline. 	Note pockets of limber pine here, a species well-adapted to high elevations and extreme conditions. The trail edges up the east flank of South Signal Mountain and breaks treeline along a wide saddle between South Signal Mountain and Signal Mountain (5.5 miles : 10,990'). 	Views are big, and the path is now intuitively followed through open tundra to either summit. 	The trail keeps north and climbs the saddle to Signal Mountain's east ridge. The main trail continues north and drops, but to reach the summit you'll break left (west) on this ridge for .1 miles to a rock wind shelter that officially marks Signal Mountain (5.92 miles : 11,262'). 	The summit area is long, flat and easily explored. Look down Signal Mountain's open north and west slopes for elk, moose, bighorn sheep and mountain goat. Consider summiting South Signal Mountain on the return, a relatively short, easily navigated excursion off the main trail. The Bulwark Ridge Trail continues north from Signal Mountain 5.8 miles to its terminus on Pingree Park Road.  Signal Mountain is located in the Comanche Peak Wilderness Area, just outside the northeastern-most corner of Rocky Mountain National Park.

203,North Fork Trail to Kettle Tarn ,rocky-mountain-national-park,10.25,7807,9237,1430,Moderate,Yes," 	The North Fork Trail stretches 7.2 miles along the North Fork Big Thompson River from the Dunraven Trailhead in the Comanche Peak Wilderness Area to Lost Falls in Rocky Mountain National Park. Kettle Tarn fills a shallow depression in a bordering moraine 5.1 miles from the trailhead.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	Hikers, runners and equestrians will enjoy miles of aspen-lined river banks, lengthy meadows, diverse forests, eleven backcountry campsites and renowned fishing along the North Fork Big Thompson en route to this interesting glacial feature.  The trail begins from the south side of the Dunraven Trailhead parking lot and drops quickly to the North Fork Big Thompson River (.35 miles : 7,670'). 	It turns upstream on a mild grade along its open, luxuriant banks. Well-spaced trees and deadfall clearings provide good viewing lanes for wildlife - notably deer, elk, bear and turkey - in this first mile. 	The trail moves quickly to a second major bridge crossing (1.15 miles : 7,804'), passing for a short time through private property and a more crowded forest. It reaches a spur for backcountry campsite #1 (2.15 miles : 8,038') and crosses back on a sturdy bridge to the south bank. 	The North Fork Trail continues easily to a side trail for horses and spur for backcountry campsite #2 (2.75 miles : 8,170'), just past which it crosses the river once more to the edge of a sloping meadow and spur to backcountry campsite #3 (2.8 miles : 8,175'). 	The trail now relaxes between the river and string of meadows, ponderosa parks and aspen stands for the next .65 miles, in which the next six backcountry campsites are located. This section is well-suited for picnics, fishing and wildlife viewing, and is a good turnaround point for shorter outings. 	The trail passes backcountry campsite #9 (3.45 miles : 8,418') and inches up into a thicker forest. It turns abruptly north (3.6 miles : 8,482') and steepens on a markedly rockier path through uniform lodgepole before curling west and edging back toward the river. 	The North Fork Trail moderates through a notably diverse forest to the Rocky Mountain National Park Boundary (4.35 miles : 8,934'), past which no dogs are allowed and anglers and backpackers must be cognizant of applicable regulations (described below). 	A variously thin and diminutive forest offers a teasing glimpse of Mount Dickinson (11,831') and more distant peaks in the Mummy Range as it undulates to the Boundary Creek Backcountry Campsite (4.5 miles : 8,968'). The trail eases to the Kettle Tarn Backcountry Campsite spur (5.07 miles : 9,230'), which you'll follow over the river on an oft-slippery log bridge to the south bank. 	A faint but intuitively followed path crests a moraine and drops to the open shore of Kettle Tarn (5.12 miles : 9,240'). The tarn is adjacent to a similarly shallow pond, both ringed by a generous, sandy shoreline that's easily explored. 	The North Fork Trail stretches 7.2 miles along the North Fork Big Thompson River from the Dunraven Trailhead in the Comanche Peak Wilderness Area to Lost Falls in Rocky Mountain National Park.

204,Lake Verna ,rocky-mountain-national-park,13.8,8391,10200,1809,Moderate,No," Lake Verna is located 6.9 miles from East Inlet Trailhead on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park. This notably large lake fills a slender, steep-walled basin midway up the East Inlet valley. The long but moderate trail features miles of cascading streams, abundant wildlife, a stop at Lone Pine Lake and 8 backcountry campsites: Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail passes splits for Adams Falls (.27 miles) and levels around the north side of East Meadow, an expansive meadow cut by slow moving oxbows on the East Inlet. This is a popular destination for anglers, and great place to see moose.  The trail enters a thinned-out lodgepole forest to Lower East Inlet backcountry campsite (2.35 miles : 8,685'), where grades steepen on rugged terrain up the valley's north wall. It crests at 3.45 miles (9,220') and drops to the creek, where healthier fir trees appear and soften the aesthetic loss from pervasive beetle kill. The trail levels by a slow section of water before rising away to the Cats Lair backcountry campsite (3.8 miles : 9,210'). It edges back to the creek and undulates to a bridge over to the south side of East Inlet (4.35 miles : 9,405'), just past which are a series of powerful cascades. The trail steepens away on a rocky-rooted path to the Gray Jay Group campsite (5.05 miles : 9,805'), then crosses a debris field created by a recent avalanche. The NPS has done a great job making it passable, but expect fallen trees and vague spots on this short segment. Travel eases on the final aproach to Lone Pine Lake (5.4 miles : 9,885'). The trail turns sharply up Lone Pine's kinetic inlet falls to open rock slabs with aerial views of the lake, crossing back to the creek's north side on this scenic climb. Grades moderate between Slick Rock backcountry campsite (5.7 miles : 10,040') and Solitaire backcountry campsite (6.0 miles : 10,145') through a slot in the valley where the creek is dammed up into three large pools by logjams and talus. This interesting stretch continues to the Upper Inlet backcountry campsite (6.6 miles : 10,190'), then crests and drops to the NW shore of Lake Verna (6.9 miles : 10,200'), the Lake Verna backcountry campsite and beginning of unimproved travel. Lake Verna's long shoreline is rugged and cluttered by thick timber, but the unimproved trail and various social trails facilitate exploration. It's worth continuing a few hundred yards up the unimproved trail to appreciate the lake's scale, and reach its open NE shore.

A moderate climb continues to the North Longs Peak Trail split (1.6 miles : 9,768'), where it banks southwest and levels through a gap between Thatchtop Mountain (12,668') and the Glacier Knobs. The trail drops to Glacier Junction (2.1 miles : 9,804'), a point marking the convergence of two glacial valleys with access to some of Rocky Mountain's most renowned destinations. Follow signs to The Loch. Travel eases over Icy Brook, then steepens away on switchbacks in a thick forest (2.5 miles : 9,985'). The valley opens upon reaching The Loch (2.95 miles : 10,192'), where the main trail veers right up its north shore. The trail hugs the shore before re-entering a dark, stream-crossed forest on the Loch's west side (3.3 miles : 10,215'). Fishing is notably good on slow moving sections of the inlet. Travel moderates to a pair of footbridges spanning Andrews Creek at the Sky Pond Trail - Andrews Glacier Trail split (3.65 miles : 10,379'). It steepens considerably in a thinning forest to the base of Timberline Falls (4.0 miles : 10,642'), a misty cascade that drops sharply from the edge of Glass Lake. Here you'll begin a short but demanding climb up the north side of the falls. Though not technical, only confident hikers should attempt this. The trail is not marked but the path is quite intuitive (there's essentially only one way to go). Heavy run-off or lingering snow can make the climb treacherous - exercise caution. Groups should allow space between individuals. The trail abruptly crests atop the falls and levels in open alpine to Glass Lake (4.15 miles : 10,808'). Glass Lake features an emerald green hue and large, populous trout. Views back down valley are exceptional from the lake's north shore. The trail - rugged and indistinguishable at times - continues up the west side of Glass Lake through krummholz and talus to Sky Pond (4.5 miles : 10,887').

Trail Map | Photo Gallery It arcs 13 miles northeast to Flattop Mountain on the Continental Divide, forming the western half of the most popular thru-hike in Rocky Mountain National Park. While few tackle the Tonahutu in its entirety, many use it to access Big Meadows, an aptly named expanse that supports large numbers of elk and moose. The Tonahutu route into Big Meadows is longer than beginning at Green Mountain Trailhead, but preferable for lighter crowds and a particularly active wildlife corridor along the creek. Mild grades and good trail conditions are ideal for families, backpackers and winter recreation, and anglers will enjoy easy access to deep oxbows in a pastoral setting. The following description begins at the Kawuneeche Visitor Center on the Tonahutu Spur: The trail heads east through dense lodgepole to join the main Tonahutu Trail at .65 miles (8,695'). The Tonahutu Trail steepens past Harbison Ditch (.8 miles), then levels for an extended period. Though the canopy is badly marred by beetle kill, the forest floor is brightened by flowers and a verdant herbaceous layer. Deadfall creates useful viewing lanes, and late-summer travelers will enjoy mushrooms and raspberry patches along the way. Tonahutu Creek is first visible at 1.1 miles, where the forest gradually opens and diversifies. Medium-sized meadows appear at 1.7 and 2.2 miles before a third opening reveals a long, open corridor that you'll follow into the main meadow (3.0 miles : 9,325'). The trail enters a contrastingly healthy swath of moss-draped fir to the Paintbrush backcountry campsite (3.55 miles : 9,265'), then edges up against the meadow (3.9 miles). Use this partially concealed segment to look for elk, moose and bear in open space. The trail passes a spur for South Meadows and Big Meadows Group campsites (4.05 miles : 9,390'), which crosses Tonahutu Creek to the east side of the meadow. A few steps ahead is the Green Mountain Trail junction on the northwest corner of Big Meadows (4.2 miles : 9.397').

The lakes, separated only by rocky outcrops, occupy an immense cirque directly below Fairchild Mountain (13,502'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery Big Crystal Lake is thought to be the deepest in Rocky Mountain National Park. Visitors will enjoy diverse forests, miles of river access, a stop at Lawn Lake and spectacular alpine landscapes on the hike to Crystal Lakes: The Lawn Lake Trail climbs 534' to the level east bank of Roaring River with good views over Horseshoe Park on the ascent (1.0 mile : 9,074'). The trail turns north upstream to the Ypsilon Lake Trail split (1.45 miles : 9,190'), a shorter but comparably challenging alternative to Lawn and Crystal Lakes. The trail rises steadily through intervals of lodgepole, fir, and aspen to the split for a trio of backcountry campsites on the west bank of Roaring River (2.9 miles : 9,632'). This designated crossing provides safe river access for anglers. The trail keeps a moderate pace through heavy timber before emerging in a wide flat (5.35 miles : 10,700') with good views north of Mummy Mountain (13,425'). It passes the Black Canyon Trail split (5.8 miles : 10,827') and climbs into a band of old-growth spruce (6.0 miles). The trail emerges from the forest and traces the flower-riddled outlet stream to the open south shore of Lawn Lake (6.45 miles : 10,987'). No horses are permitted beyond this point. Lawn Lake is one of Rocky Mountain National Park's largest subalpine lakes. Its perimeter is long, flat and easy to explore. Mummy Mountain looms east, while Fairchild Mountain (13,502') and Hagues Peak (13,560') stand north of an unnamed 12,541' peak directly over Lawn Lake's west shore. The trail undulates up the east shore of Lawn Lake, clearing treeline at 7.25 miles (11,125'). This gorgeous area is highlighted by an array of wildflowers, braided streams, and striking views of Fairchild Mountain, Hagues Peak, and Mummy Mountain. The trail reaches 'The Saddle' - Crystal Lakes Trail split at 7.85 miles (11,400') and bears left toward the center of the valley. It crests at 11,546', then drops from the east to west side of the valley. The trail nadirs at the base of a waterfall and begins a steep climb up the valley's west side. The trail is generally easy to follow but may be obscured by overgrowth, runoff or lingering snow. If unable to follow the precise route, use the waterfall and Fairchild Mountain for guidance (Crystal Lakes sit just beneath Fairchild Mountain; do not follow the waterfall, as it leads away from the lakes). You'll pass a large pond just before reaching Little Crystal Lake (7.75 miles : 11,511'), and thread a series of immense boulders to Big Crystal Lake (7.95 miles : 11,511'). Large boulders around each encumber exploration, but creative maneuvering will lead to favorable vantages of this vast alpine area. A short but steep route splits off the Crystal Lakes Trail to 'The Saddle', a 12,398' pass between Fairchild Mountain and Hagues Peak.

227,Lily Lake ,rocky-mountain-national-park,0.9,8930,8930,0,Easy,No," Lily Lake is located six miles south of Estes Park, just east of the Rocky Mountain National Park boundary along Highway 7. This short loop at the base of Estes Cone provides sweeping views that include Mt Meeker ( 13,911'), Twin Sisters (11,428'), and Longs Peak (14,259') - the highest point in Rocky Mountain National Park. Lily Lake is ideal for families or those with limited time or abilities. Maximize sunlight by traveling clockwise in the morning, and counterclockwise in the evening.  Extend your trip by hiking the Lily Ridge Trail, which breaks off the loop and climbs 350' in just .2 miles to Lily Ridge above the lake.  Enos Mills - the Father of Rocky Mountain National Park  The landscape surrounding Lily Lake inspired a young naturalist named Enos Mills and led to the formation of Rocky Mountain National Park.  In 1884, at only fourteen years old, Mills left Kansas and moved to Colorado, settling in a cabin at the base of Longs Peak. The following year he climbed Longs Peak for the first time, a feat he'd repeat over 250 times.  Mills spent his entire life devoted to the conservation of the Rocky Mountains and in 1907 he proposed that this region of the Rockies be officially designated as a national park. In 1915, his dream became reality with the establishment of Rocky Mountain National Park. Mills died seven years later but his dedication to the preservation of this area will live on forever.

It fills a deep cirque carved from the base of Mt Meeker (13,911'), Longs Peak (14,259') and Mount Lady Washington (13,281'). Longs Peak's iconic 'Diamond' rises 2456' above this striking alpine lake. Visitors will enjoy miles of open tundra and sensational views on the hike to Chasm Lake: Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail climbs steadily from the Longs Peak Ranger Station through lodgepole, spruce and fir. Alpine Brook, largely concealed by timber, is the only notable feature before crossing the top of a long cascade at treeline (1.85 miles : 10,615'), where the forest is quickly reduced to bands of krummholz. Krummholz - a German word meaning twisted wood - describes the stunted, irregular growth patterns of trees in the ecological transition zone between subalpine forests and alpine tundra. Poor soil, thin air and extreme weather limit growth at these elevations. Still, the tundra's nutrient-rich grasses, plants, and lichens support marmot, elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat.  The trail bends toward the Longs Peak diamond from the Battle Mountain Backcountry Campsite spur (2.45 miles : 10,956') to the Chasm Lake - East Longs Peak Trail split (3.25 miles : 11,518'). Stock is not permitted on the Chasm Lake Trail beyond this point. The trail bears SW along the north wall of a deep gorge carved by Roaring Fork (Chasm's outlet) with views of Peacock Pool. It crests and drops across a steep slope to an alpine bench that spans the upper valley and separates upper and lower Columbine Falls (3.8 miles : 11,580').

Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	This lightly traveled loop is highlighted by abundant wildlife, terrific views, mature aspen groves and exceptional autumn foliage.  The following description travels clockwise from the Lumpy Ridge Trailhead, recommended for morning light across the MacGregor Ranch meadows. Note that, regardless of direction, the trail begins outside Park Boundaries and staying on designated trails is required: 	The trail undulates along the south slope of Lumpy Ridge to the National Park Boundary and Gem Lake spur (.6 miles). It winds through sculpted boulders and mixed forest to the former Twin Owls Parking Lot, past which it splits left down the Black Canyon Trail (.75 miles). 	The trail drops through a broad, south-facing meadow with panoramas of Longs Peak (14,259'), Estes Cone (11,011'), Taylor Peak (13,163'), Powell Peak (13,208') and McHenrys Peak (13,327'). It passes climbing access points (The Book Area: 1.55 miles, The Pear: 1.87 miles), enters a thick ponderosa forest (2.0 miles), and re-enters the Park through a gate (2.1 miles : 7,990'). 	Here it begins a long, steady climb to the Black Canyon Trail split (3.88 miles : 9,092').

Moraine Park is one such place where glaciers once settled and subsequently receded, leaving a broad, level expanse in its place.  Moraine Park is cut by the Big Thompson River and Cub Creek, which hold abundant trout and support an array of wildlife. Every fall large elk herds congregate in these food-rich meadows for their annual rut, a spectacular ritual where dominant bulls battle for mating rights.

This two mile meadow system is lightly traveled but rife with wildlife, particularly elk and moose. Visitors will enjoy rare solitude and excellent wildlife viewing on the hike to Long Meadows.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	It's worth noting that park signs and various maps differ on the length of unimproved travel, as well the exact route (see more in Worth Noting below). Regardless, hikers should anticipate several miles of x-country travel on uneven terrain and plan travel time accordingly:  The Onahu Creek Trail heads NE on a moderate grade in a tall lodgepole forest. It crosses Onahu Creek at 1.35 miles (9,240') and closely follows it much of the way to the Long Meadows Trail. Note the introduction of spruce and fir as you climb higher. 	You'll cross Onahu Creek again just before reaching the Long Meadows Trail split (2.8 miles : 9,630'), where a sign points north and indicates that 1.6 miles of unimproved conditions lie ahead. Good navigational instincts and a fair amount of athleticism are now required. 	Steep terrain, stream crossings, deadfall, boulders and an absence of trail markings make travel difficult. While the upper trail is quite easy to follow, the first few hundred yards are challenging from a navigational standpoint. 	The faint route can be covered with snow well into summer, stream crossings are unaided, and well-worn animal tracks can lead off-course. 	Just past the split for Long Meadows, bear left on the west edge of a small marshy meadow - the trail is very faint here. This will lead to the stream where an old footbridge - currently defunct and impassable - indicates a good spot to cross and pick up the trail again. 	If you travel straight through and / or along the marsh's eastern edge, you will eventually cross the same stream and have a similar challenge of regaining the trail once across. 	Regardless of your route, understanding where the trail is generally heading will likely place you back on it. This is part of the fun! The trail is notably easier to follow as you climb higher. 	The final .3+ miles travel up switchbacks on a steep, south-facing slope. This is an especially pretty stretch of forest. The trail levels out just over a ridge on the edge of a small pond, around which you can travel in either direction. Long Meadows is just north of this pond. 	Timber gives way to open space on the southernmost edge of Long Meadows (4.45 miles : 10,220').

This two mile meadow system is lightly traveled but rife with wildlife, particularly elk and moose. Visitors will enjoy rare solitude and excellent wildlife viewing on the hike to Long Meadows. Trail Map | Photo Gallery	It's worth noting that park signs and various maps differ on the length of unimproved travel, as well the exact route (see more in Worth Noting below). Regardless, hikers should anticipate several miles of x-country travel on uneven terrain and plan travel time accordingly: The Onahu Creek Trail heads NE on a moderate grade in a tall lodgepole forest.

238,Cache La Poudre Trail ,rocky-mountain-national-park,18.4,10747,9753,-994,Moderate,No," 	The Cache La Poudre Trail begins at the Poudre Lake Trailhead on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park. It follows the Cache La Poudre River 9.2 miles down a wide open valley to the Mummy Pass Trail junction, 1.3 miles from the Corral Creek Trailhead in the Comanche Peak Wilderness.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	This lightly used trail offers excellent wildlife viewing, solitude and big open spaces. Mild terrain and modest elevation gains make the Cache La Poudre Trail achievable in a day, but consider camping overnight to fully explore and enjoy this immense river-valley corridor:  The trail begins north of Poudre Lake on the west side of the valley, and immediately drops to the west side of the headwater. It runs close to the forest edge, but mostly through open space on a gentle, rolling grade. 	The first 4.5 miles are an unmaintained cross-country route between the river and forest. Despite that classification, the trail is fairly well-defined and intuitively followed. Hikers should have little trouble keeping track of their location given the distinct path it takes down valley and by the river. 	The same path is used extensively by elk, which readily take this path of least-resistance. The trail loses clarity through 4.5 miles (10,338') as you pass a forested knoll on the west side of the valley - edge back down toward the river, and the trail will soon reappear. 	You'll reach spurs for the Cache Campsite and Chapin Creek Campsite along a good section of trail (approx 5.25 miles and 5.5 miles from the trailhead). Note these signs may be in disrepair and difficult to see - if camping, anticipate these signs and use a map for guidance. 	Here you'll notice the main valley narrowing, and branching into smaller valleys that run W-NW. The trail now runs through intervals of dense montane forest before emerging in a long, open area adjacent to the river (7.2 miles : 9,985'). 	It re-enters the forest on a high bank (8.25 miles), then drops to a willow-marsh along an oxbow (8.8 miles : 9,965'). Travel levels to the Mummy Pass Trail split at a major bridge (9.2 miles : 9,753'). 	The Mummy Pass Trail turns east over the bridge to the Hague Creek Campsite, located just above the confluence of Hague Creek and the Cache La Poudre. It continues 2.6 miles east to the Mirror Lake Trail junction. You may also hike another .5 miles from the Mummy Pass Trail split to the Park Boundary and Corral Creek Trailhead in the Comanche Peak Wilderness. 	The Cache La Poudre Trail begins at the Poudre Lake Trailhead on the west side of Rocky Mountain National Park.

The hike begins with a short, steep climb that moderates through treeline and open tundra to Fall River Pass on Trail Ridge Road.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  Views are exceptional, highlighted by lengthy sections of the Never Summer Range, Cache La Poudre River valley and Forest Canyon. Few Park trails offer as much alpine exposure on such mild grades. 	The Poudre Lake Trailhead is located on Milner Pass (10,759') along the Continental Divide. The 'Great Divide' separates drainages that flow into the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 	The Cache La Poudre forms just north of Milner Pass and drains into the Platte River, which flows into the Missouri River and eventually the Mississippi before reaching the Gulf of Mexico (Atlantic). 	South of Milner Pass, Beaver Creek drains into the Colorado River, which flows through the Grand Canyon and into the Gulf of California (Pacific): 	The trail begins on the south edge of Poudre Lake, where you'll find signs for Milner Pass and Mt Ida a few steps from the trailhead on the lakeshore. It turns sharply uphill and winds through a pretty subalpine forest to the Milner Pass - Mt Ida Trail split (.6 miles : 11,072'). 	The Milner Pass Trail turns northeast and levels in a thinning forest with emerging views of the Never Summer Range. It moves quickly through glades that widen to expansive meadows where elk and deer are common (1.75 miles). 	It rises nominally to  Forest Canyon Pass (2.5 miles : 11,320'), where you can take a few steps off trail and peer down Forest Canyon and the headwaters of the Big Thompson River. Look for bighorn sheep on higher slopes, and moose by a string of alpine ponds and meadows just beyond the pass. 	The trail clears treeline with views across the upper Cache La Poudre River Valley, which runs over 9 miles north from Milner Pass (read about x-country travel on the Cache La Poudre River Trail). 	It keeps a modest grade to the terminus on Trail Ridge Road at the Alpine Visitor Center (4.1 miles : 11,796').

240,Mt Ida ,rocky-mountain-national-park,9.6,10753,12889,2136,Moderate-Strenuous,No," Mt Ida (12,889') is located 4.8 miles from Poudre Lake Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park. It's arguably one of the Park's finest alpine treks, but receives little attention because the trail does not appear on most maps, and the trailhead itself makes no mention of Mt Ida as a destination. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Despite its classification as a cross-country route, the Mt Ida Trail is in fact well-defined (save the final approach), and quite moderate by Rocky Mountain standards. Note that trail signs suggest the summit is only 4.0 miles, a small but significant discrepancy at these elevations. Plan travel time accordingly. 3.6 miles of the trail run through open tundra - get an early start to avoid thunderstorms that reliably develop each afternoon throughout the summer. The last 1.3 miles are not well defined, but follow cairns and an intuitive route up to the summit. Visitors will enjoy spectacular landscapes that include expansive tundra flats and panoramic views across the Never Summer Range, Gorge Lakes and lightly traveled interior mountains: The trail begins on the south edge of Poudre Lake, where you'll find signs for Milner Pass and Mt Ida a few steps from the trailhead on the lakeshore. It turns sharply uphill and winds through a pretty subalpine forest to the Milner Pass - Mt Ida Trail split (.6 miles : 11,072'). The Mt Ida Trail turns south and climbs steadily before moderating through the vestiges of treeline (1.2 miles : 11,392'). Here you'll have stunning views across the Never Summer Range, and south along the Divide. Look for bighorn sheep and elk, which frequent these high slopes. The trail heads S-SE just west of and below the Divide on a variously mild and moderate grade. Though very clear, be mindful of equally well-defined game trails that follow a similar route. The trail undulates to a cairn-marked fork on the edge of an expansive flat (2.8 miles : 12,140') - bear right. It dips across the flat to a saddle on the Divide (3.4 miles : 12,015'), which overlooks a pretty alpine meadow down the east side (GPS Point #10).  Though seemingly accessible, snow cornices make the tempting drop-in only for the skilled and equipped. The trail reaches the far side of the saddle, where it abruptly fades in decidedly rockier terrain (3.5 miles :12,037'). Here you'll begin the 1.3 mile cross-country portion of the hike, which follows cairns and a decent boot track on an arcing push to the summit. It's difficult to pick out every cairn in this indistinguishable terrain, but obvious where you must go - up. Tread lightly on delicate grasses and step on rock whenever possible. Mt Ida (4.8 miles : 12,889') is just a small rocky nub atop the Continental Divide, but optimally located with exceptional views of the Never Summer Range (west), and Gorge Lakes basin (east). Maneuver about the summit for views of Highest Lake, Azure Lake, Inkwell Lake, Arrowhead Lake and their glacial benefactors. These lakes form the headwaters of a major tributary to the Big Thompson River, which cuts through Forest Canyon below. It's possible to drop into this idyllic basin, but requires significant route finding and athleticism. A razor-thin saddle connects Ida with neighboring Chief Cheley Peak (12,504'), which joins Cracktop (12,766'), Mount Julian (12,928') and Terra Tomah Mountain (12,718') to form the massive Gorge Lakes cirque.

Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	Low elevations and mild grades make it accessible year-round, an ideal choice for families, runners, and winter recreation.  A high water table under Beaver Meadows creates fine, moist soil conditions that do not effectively support tree growth. These meadow-creating conditions are perpetuated over time by grazing wildlife and natural fires. 	Surrounding slopes, where soil conditions improve, support ponderosa woodlands, aspen, fir and lodgepole pine. This rich mosaic of meadow and forest provides ideal habitat, safe passage, and abundant food for elk, deer, bear, mountain lion, badger, fox and coyote. 	The following description travels clockwise on the Beaver Mountain Loop: 	The trail splits just a few steps from the trailhead to form a short loop within the loop. The forks are equidistant and rejoin at a sign for Trail Ridge Road - Ute Meadow Campsite (.6 miles : 8,568'). Curiously, the Beaver Mountain Trail is not listed on these signs, but heading for Trail Ridge Road will keep you on track in each instance. 	The Beaver Mountain Trail leaves open meadow and climbs into a mixed pine-fir forest. It wraps around a large outcrop (1.3 miles), crosses a stream, and heads SW up a narrow gulch to the Ute Trail split (1.65 miles : 9,025'). 	The low rise to your left is the top of a divisive moraine between Moraine Park (south) and Beaver Meadows (north).

Visitors will enjoy excellent views of Longs Peak, large meadows, aspen groves, and a good chance to see elk: The trail heads south through a flat, broad meadow for .3 miles to the first of several small ridges.  The trail dips and rolls gently through sparse forests and open rocky areas to the north edge of Moraine Meadows.  The trail drops more rapidly to the Moraine Park Campground (.8 miles).   It's important to note here that this 'main' trail is bisected and paralleled at times by several unnamed trails that form small figure eights through the immediate area, especially in the Moraine Park Campground vicinity.   While having a good map will make staying on the correct trail easier, the absence of trail signs may cause temporary confusion.   Continuing south with the Campground on your left should serve as an adequate bearing. The trail ends unceremoniously at the Livery on the Fern Lake access road.

Moraines are ridges of glacial till pushed aside by glacial movements. Scale the ridge for views across Moraine Park before pressing on. 	The Ute Trail rises on a narrow and rugged path that clings to a steep valley wall over the Big Thompson River. The trail undulates to a crest (2.15 miles : 9,169'), then drops beside a trickle that is Windy Gulch Creek. 	It gradually levels into a healthier forest and skirts the edge of lower Ute Meadows, a damp, tall grass complex ideal for seeing fox, coyote, elk, deer, bear, and even mountain lion (2.35 miles : 9,245'). 	The trail steepens back into a thinly treed forest to the Ute Meadows Backcountry Campsite (2.9 miles : 9,423'). The forest breaks here on the edge of upper Ute Meadows with a good look up Windy Gulch. The meadow is wide, cluttered, dry, and dotted with a handful of aspen. 	Note the introduction of white pine, a hardy conifer  =not typically found at these elevations in the Park. Their presence is indicative of the harsh conditions and poor soil beds of Windy Gulch. 	The trail heads northwest on a clear, moderate grade back into the forest (3.35 miles : 9,745') that quickly grows prohibitively steep and ill-defined on a twisting, oft-obstructed track. Cairns provide some guidance, but are difficult to find and follow. Note that you'll gain nearly 780' in just .4 miles upon re-entering the forest (3.75 miles : 10,205'). 	In the likely event you feel off -course, follow natural contours of the land and steer yourself into the center of the gulch. The trail is quite easy to find once above treeline, and the heading intuitively followed to the top of Windy Gulch at Timberline Pass (4.5 miles : 11,495'). 	Here the trail levels abruptly in the wide open tundra with well-earned views back across Windy Gulch and the southeast quadrant of Rocky Mountain National Park. 	A wide, flat path continues northwest along Tombstone Ridge with sweeping views across miles of open tundra and Forest Canyon to the west.

The maintained trail ends on a ridge over Pear Lake, where a spur splits north to backcountry campsites, and a social trail drops around the south shore with views of Mount Copeland and Ogallala Peak (13,138'). The Hutcheson Lakes and Cony Lake (11,512') are accessible via social trails and intuitive routing up the drainage. Pear Lake is located 6.5 miles from the Finch Lake Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park. This lightly used trail is highlighted by aspen groves, Finch Lake and long stretches of moss-draped forests en route to the lake. Once used as a reservoir, Pear Lake has been successfully restored to its natural state:Trail Map | Photo GalleryThe trail initially heads east and climbs 470' in just .8 miles to a sharp hairpin turn, where it bends southwest and levels across grassy aspen - ponderosa slopes. Well-spaced trees create good viewing lanes for wildlife on this fast stretch.The trail moves steadily past connections for Allenspark Trailhead-access (1.4 miles : 8,974') and Calypso Falls (2.35 miles : 9,520'). Gaps in the forest offer good views up Wild Basin toward Mount Copeland (13,176') and Ouzel Peak (12,716'), and north to Mt Meeker (13.911').The trail steepens to a clearing where lightning-induced fire struck in 1978 (2.55 miles : 9,740'). Despite ostensible damage, forests require periodic fire to thin timber, replenish soil and create space for new growth.The trail re-enters a dense spruce-fir forest to a footbridge (3.85 miles : 10,072'). Small streams, Spanish beard and kinnickinnick accent this pleasant stretch.Variously level and rugged travel resumes to a crest and sharp right turn down winding switchbacks (3.95 miles : 10,069'). Fringe season travelers should anticipate this turn, as snow may conceal it.The trail winds steeply down for .25 miles to the east shore of Finch Lake (4.35 miles), with easier access from the north shore at 4.6 miles (9,912').The trail hugs the lake past backcountry campsites and drops across Coney Creek (4.65 miles : 9,905'). It continues on variously steep grades up the north side of a widening valley.

252,Sandbeach Lake ,rocky-mountain-national-park,8.8,8312,10283,1971,Moderate,No," Sandbeach Lake (10,283') is located 4.4 miles from the Wild Basin Entrance Station in Rocky Mountain National Park. It's one of the Park's deepest lakes at nearly 50', and aptly named for its wide, sandy shore. Sandbeach Lake is ringed by gnarled bristlecone pine in a broad flat free of confining valley walls, and its open perimeter gives the area a uniquely spacious feel. Trail Map | Photo Gallery In 1988 the Park removed earth dams on the lake's outlet, replacing it with willow and brush to create spawning habitat for greenback cutthroat trout. A small but stable breeding population exists today. Good fishing and a beach-like setting make this a desirable overnight destination. The basin is susceptible to strong winds and cooler temperatures, as the presence of bristlecone pine might suggest. Aspen and leafy ground cover line much of the trail, and produce brilliant fall colors: The trail rises quickly over North St Vrain Creek through ponderosa, lodgepole and aspen to the Meeker Park Trail split (1.35 miles : 8,990'). Below to the north is Copeland Moraine - take a few steps along the Meeker Park Trail for a closer look. The trail continues west on a mild but rocky grade lined by aspen and thick ground cover. Campers Creek is occasionally audible but seldom visible as you pass spurs for the Hole-in-the-Wall and Campers Creek backcountry campsites (1.88 miles : 9,172' and 2.1 miles : 9,265', respectively). The rugged trail crosses a small creek (2.55 miles : 9,543') and continues steeply to the Beaver Mill backcountry campsite (3.0 miles : 9,680'). It levels momentarily near the Hunters Creek backcountry campsite (3.25 miles : 9,746'), crosses Hunters Creek (3.5 miles : 9,840') on a footbridge and begins a rocky, 443' climb to the north shore of Sandbeach Lake (4.4 miles : 10,283'). Social trails follow Sandbeach Lake's open east shore, with terrific views of Mt Meeker (13,911') and easy lake access. Bristlecone pine ring the lake, which are fairly uncommon at these elevations in this part of the Park. Poor soil and blustery winds across the flat, open basin create hostile growing conditions similar to higher alpine environments where they're typically found.

The trail follows North St Vrain Creek and Ouzel Creek through diverse forests and an interesting burn-recovery area into the upper valley. A steep push leads through treeline to the lake, where an unmaintained route continues along the inlet to its headwaters at Pipit Lake. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Visitors will enjoy varied terrain, several waterfalls, access to Ouzel Lake and excellent fishing on the hike to Bluebird Lake: The trail rises gently beside North St Vrain Creek to spurs for Lower and Upper Copeland Falls (.35 and .45 miles). Mild travel continues to the backcountry campsite access trail (1.35 miles : 8,860'), crosses the creek and climbs .45 miles to Calypso Cascades (1.8 miles : 9,108'). The trail wraps up a north-facing valley wall and passes through an area touched by lightning-induced fire in 1978 (2.1 miles : 9,100').  Despite significant damage, the forest is in a natural state of recovery. Grasses and young aspen fill newly opened spaces, and in time spruce and fir will return and restore the forest to its ecological climax. The trail steepens to Ouzel Falls (2.6 miles : 9,366'), drops and rises back to the Ouzel Lake - Thunder Lake Trail split (2.95 miles : 9,418'). Bear left for a short, moderately steep climb to a divisive E-W ridge between the Ouzel Creek drainage (south) and North St Vrain Creek drainage (north). The trail bends west through the heart of the 1978 Ouzel Fire zone with rangy views through a culled forest: Pilot Mountain (12,222'), Mount Alice (13,310'), Mt Meeker (13,911) and Longs Peak (14,259') are visible to the northwest, while Mount Copeland's (13,176') north flank looms over the Ouzel drainage to the southwest. The trail undulates along the exposed ridge to the Ouzel Lake spur (4.5 miles : 10,026'), and continues on a more rugged path into an unaffected swath of forest (5.2 miles : 10,175'). It rises quickly through an attractive composite of mature spruce, glades, wildflowers and streams to the Upper Ouzel Creek Backcountry Campsite (5.9 miles : 10,602'). Here the forest thins at the base of a steep climb beside Bluebird Lake's outlet stream. The trail negotiates rocks slabs and talus through treeline on the final approach; look for cairns or simply follow the stream if concealed by snow. The trail crests a few dozen yards over Bluebird Lake and scrambles down to the shore (6.3 miles : 10,978'). Ouzel Peak (12,716') rises prominently from the lake's west shore, with Mount Copeland's north flank and Mahana Peak's (12,632') southeast flank completing the cirque wall.

Mild travel continues to the backcountry campsite access trail (1.35 miles : 8,860'), crosses the creek and climbs .45 miles to Calypso Cascades (1.8 miles : 9,108'). The trail wraps up a north-facing valley wall and passes through an area stricken by lightning-induced fire in 1978 (2.1 miles : 9,100'). Despite significant damage, the forest is in a natural state of recovery. Grasses and wildflowers brighten the hillsides, while young aspen and lodgepole emerge in replenished soils. In time, spruce and fir will overtake them and return the forest to its ecological climax. The trail steepens to Ouzel Falls (2.6 miles : 9,366'), drops and rises back to the Ouzel Lake - Thunder Lake Trail split (2.95 miles : 9,418'). Follow signs for Thunder Lake. The trail undulates higher and crosses back over the creek to its 2nd connection with the backcountry campsite access trail (3.35 miles : 9,505'). Here it steadies and straightens on a northwest heading for 1.4 miles to the Thunder Lake - Lion Lake Trail split (4.7 miles : 10,025'). Make good time on this pleasant but unspectacular stretch to allow more time for difficult segments ahead, and exploration of the lakes. The Thunder Lake Trail bends northwest and steepens into a thinning forest that reveals an attractive network of ponds, streams, and meadows. Mahana Peak (12,632'), Tanima Peak (12,420') and Pilot Mountain (12,222') can be seen at different points on the final ascent. The trail veers left at the Thunder Lake Group Campsite spur (6.45 miles : 10,676' - the trail's highest point) and drops to Thunder Lake (6.6 miles : 10,574'). Thunder Lake is framed by Tanima Peak (south), and Pilot Mountain and Mount Alice (13,310') to the northwest. Ponds and wildflowers dot Thunder Lake's outlet area, and thinly treed knolls on the lake's edge offer secluded vantages - allow to time to explore this scenic area. A Ranger Patrol Cabin on the lake's northeast shore posts useful area information. Thunder Lake is located 6.6 miles from Wild Basin Trailhead in Rocky Mountain National Park.

259,Turquoise Lakes ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,14.4,8355,11308,2953,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," The Turquoise Lakes are located 6.65 and 7.2 miles from Beaver Lake Trailhead in the Holy Cross Wilderness. The lakes form the headwaters of Beaver Creek, a major tributary of the Eagle River. Lower Turquoise Lake fills a large, level basin surrounded by rolling meadows, and Upper Turquoise Lake is located .6 miles and 210' up in a secluded bowl just below the valley headwall. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Lower Turquoise Lake features ideal camping and fishing terrain along its open perimeter. The upper lake is a relatively quick excursion to a more rugged but equally compelling setting. Two trails access the Turquoise Lakes: the Beaver Lake Trail which begins in the Beaver Creek Ski Resort, and the West Grouse Creek Trail from Grouse Creek Trailhead on Highway 24. The following description begins at Beaver Creek, preferable for long stretches of mild grades and pristine forests along the water (see Worth Noting below for important trailhead access and distance information): The Beaver Lake Trail begins at the top of Village Road in the Beaver Creek Ski Resort. Scale a grassy knoll and merge onto a service road, which rises past several maintenance facilities and ski-runs. It passes connections for Allie's Way and the Village-to-Village Trail up to a bridge over Beaver Creek (1.55 miles : 9,165'). It keeps a steady pace through airy slopes to the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (2.4 miles : 9,660'), where it narrows on singletrack to the edge of Beaver Lake (2.6 miles : 9,746'). The trail continues past Beaver Lake and moderates on a long, pleasant stretch highlighted by mild grades, braided streams, verdant ground cover and hanging moss. There's little beetle-kill and minimal deadfall in this notably healthy spruce-fir forest. Travel is quick up to a sturdy footbridge that crosses (west) over a cascading section of Beaver Creek (4.7 miles : 10,355'). It's easy to miss, but a fading trail on the water's edge will lead your eyes to it. Once over, the trail skirts the base of a talus slope and levels back into heavy forest. It reaches a double-bridge crossing back to the east side of the creek at 5.45 miles (10,595'), past which it runs up the side of a long, open meadow. Take a few steps off-trail to scan for wildlife. The trail shifts quickly and grows faint while transitioning through the subalpine. Thinning timber reveals expansive meadows on either side of Beaver Creek leading to the Grouse Mountain (West Grouse Creek) trail split (6.6 miles : 11,075'). Here the trail temporarily disappears, but is intuitively followed through a marshy flat to the NE corner of Lower Turquoise Lake (6.65 miles : 11,095').  The basin is broad and level with little distinction between the lake and terra firma in some places. The shoreline is obstacle free (save a few bands of willow), and easy to explore. The Upper Turquoise Lake Trail is located across the outlet stream, a few steps past the Grouse Mt Trail split. A small log spans the creek but is fairly anonymous; to pick up the trail, simply cross the creek and it will soon appear. The trail leads around the lake across damp meadows and low rises with drier conditions for camping. It curls SW and rises gently through pockets of spruce to the edge of Upper Turquoise Lake (7.2 miles : 11,308'). The lake is hemmed by the steep valley headwall and some rugged terrain, but easy enough to maneuver about. You'll find secluded nooks to camp, but open space around the lower lake is arguably more conducive.

260,Broome Hut ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,2.0,10629,11342,713,Moderate,Yes," Broome Hut is located one mile west of Highway 40 along the Second Creek Trail near Berthoud Pass. It's among the newest renovations in the 10th Mountain Division Hut System, which manages 34 backcountry huts across Colorado. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Second Creek Basin receives about 500"" of snow each year - no secret to backcountry skiers - but the re-opening of Broome Hut is sure to increase summer traffic as word spreads. The trail climbs 700' in just one mile from Highway 40 to the hut, which overlooks an idyllic alpine basin (1.0 mile : 11,243'). It continues west another half mile through treeline before ending abruptly on the edge of open tundra (1.55 miles : 11,611'). Note this cairn-marked point (GPS point #5), which may be hidden by willow mats and hard to find. Cross-country travel begins here with a short, steep climb to the Mount Nystrom Trail (2.1 miles : 11,925'). It's an approximate point, as the Mount Nystrom Trail is only marked by cairns and posts spread across long distances in open tundra. The tundra is uncommonly broad and level here - it almost feels like Kansas, only at 12,000' with mountains on every horizon. Views include the Vasquez Peaks (west), Winter Park and Rocky Mountain (north), and Mt Flora (east). Elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat are drawn to these well-developed alpine grasses, and if they're anywhere in the area, you'll see them. Alpine flowers are abundant, peaking by mid-July.

261,Mt Flora ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,6.45,11307,13132,1825,Moderate,Yes," Mt Flora (13,132') is located 3.2 miles from Berthoud Pass along the Continental Divide Trail. It stands high over Ethel Lake and the Mad Creek drainage with exceptional views in all directions.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery Moderate grades make Mt Flora among the most accessible 13ers in the Winter Park area. The CDT continues on to a saddle below Breckenridge Peak (12,889'), an easy off trail scramble. Visitors will enjoy miles of airy alpine travel and diverse tundra ecology on the hike to Mt Flora and Breckenridge Peak: The trail begins on a service road that winds steeply over Berthoud Pass in a thinning forest. Look for signs of lynx, which have been documented in this area. At .85 miles (11,675') the CDT splits left off the road and narrows on single track through treeline. It moderates on a NE heading across broad, verdant slopes with well-developed grasses and forbs that attract elk, bighorn sheep and mountain goat. The trail rises steadily through 12,000' (1.3 miles) to a saddle below Colorado Mines Peak (12,493'), and good views down the Blue Creek drainage (1.6 miles : 12,157'). It levels across the saddle before climbing steeply up the far side (1.95 miles : 12,365'). Travel eases to a false summit (2.35 miles : 12,723') and levels again for half a mile above the Mad Creek drainage. Cushion and mat plants cover the area, primary tundra constituents that help build soil beds by trapping organic debris. Over time, grasses and forbs will take hold in deeper soils to form plots of tundra turf.  Also note the ubiquitous big root spring beauty plant, whose taproot can reach 6' deep. The trail pitches up at 2.85 miles (12,880') on the final push to Mt Flora (3.22 miles : 13,132'). A tall cairn marks the summit, a large flat area with several rock wind shelters. Maneuver about to see Ethel Lake (north), which boasts a brilliant turquois hue. The CDT continues down the east side of Mt Flora toward Breckenridge Peak. It's initially faint but clarifies across the broad connecting saddle (3.9 miles : 12,748'). The CDT doesn't scale Breckenridge Peak, but the summit is fairly obvious (it's the highest point on your heading before tilting down hill). Find a good line for the short climb to the top (4.1 miles : 12,889'). Breckenridge Peak adds approximately 1.8 miles and 550' total elevation gain to the roundtrip hike.

262,Stanley Mountain ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,7.7,11307,12521,1214,Moderate,Yes," Stanley Mountain is located 3.85 miles west of Berthoud Pass along the Continental Divide Trail. This airy alpine trek climbs steeply through treeline then levels in open tundra for two miles to the summit. Good trail conditions and mild grades are ideal for families, an acclimation hike and winter travel. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Views are exceptional throughout, highlighted by Vasquez Peak and the Mt Flora massif. Visitors will also enjoy diverse alpine ecology and wildlife on the hike to Stanley Mountain: From Berthoud Pass, cross HWY 40 to the braided trail on the west side of the road. Choose the well-defined track that cuts SW across the hillside and ignore social trails heading straight up. The trail rises steadily in a healthy subalpine forest with emerging views to the east. Look for grouse and snowshoe hare in this prime habitat. It clears treeline (.85 miles : 11,850') and levels on a high, thin ridge to the base of a steep wall (1.25 miles : 11,930'). Strenuous switchbacks reach open tundra (1.55 miles : 12,253') where travel eases up another ridge to the Vasquez Peak Wilderness Boundary (1.85 miles : 12,370'). Here the trail bends SW and moderates atop the Divide, undulating subtly over three distinct basins which can be cumulatively taxing at these elevations. As with many segments of the CDT in Colorado the east side drops precipitously, while the west slopes gently down. Glass untracked basins below for elk and moose on this fast-moving stretch. The trail rises up the south side of a third basin (3.5 miles : 12,370') with your first glimpse of Stanley Mountain, a nondescript rock pile just off trail. It runs just below the unmarked summit with a very short scramble to the top (3.85 miles : 12,521'). This unassuming nub is easy to miss, but a decisive drop just past it is a reliable indicator. Vasquez Peak (12,947') stands prominently to the west, accessible off the CDT on a sparingly defined but intuitively followed route.

263,Booth Lake ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.7,8422,11434,3012,Strenuous,Yes," Booth Lake is located 4.35 miles from Booth Lake Trailhead on I-70 in Vail CO. It fills a slender basin at the head of a steep walled valley in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. The Booth Creek Trail is a compelling destination in itself, highlighted by Booth Falls, mature aspen, abundant flowers and long alpine meadows en route to the lake: Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail winds north through grassy hillsides to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary, and gradually straightens up a widening valley framed by towering, red-hued walls. Grades moderate from 1.0 - 1.5 miles through a colorful mix of aspen, leafy ground cover and berries. The trail grows rugged leading up to Booth Falls (1.9 miles : 9,720'), which drop 60' in several stages (visible and accessible from numerous spurs off the main trail). The trail continues steeply over the falls where aspen give way to a thick spruce forest. It drops and levels briefly along Booth Creek, a useful reprieve before another strenuous push breaks treeline (2.5 miles : 10,165') and crests at the foot of a long, narrow valley (2.85 miles : 10,490'). The valley floor and slopes above are thinly wooded, a good place to find wildlife and clear camping terrain. The valley bends northwest on a mild grade beneath craggy, talus strewn walls. Behind you are emerging views of the Holy Cross range and portions of the Vail ski area. The trail moves quickly up-valley through open meadow and thin bands of spruce to the base of a final, steep climb (3.95 miles : 11,120'). The trail twists quickly and unevenly through large rock slabs and boulders to a crest, where it drops to the grassy east shore of Booth Lake (4.35 miles : 11,434'). Booth Lake is deceptively long with a small island in its center. The lake is easy to explore, as are the open slopes above. A low ridge on the south shore has a particularly good view across the basin, and back down valley on the route you took to reach it. Booth Lake is located 4.35 miles from Booth Lake Trailhead on I-70 in Vail CO. It fills a slender basin at the head of a steep walled valley in the Eagles Nest Wilderness. The Booth Creek Trail is a compelling destination in itself, highlighted by Booth Falls, mature aspen, abundant flowers and long alpine meadows en route to the lake:Trail Map | Photo GalleryThe trail winds north through grassy hillsides to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary, and gradually straightens up a widening valley framed by towering, red-hued walls.Grades moderate from 1.0 - 1.5 miles through a colorful mix of aspen, leafy ground cover and berries. The trail grows rugged leading up to Booth Falls (1.9 miles : 9,720'), which drop 60' in several stages (visible and accessible from numerous spurs off the main trail).The trail continues steeply over the falls where aspen give way to a thick spruce forest.It drops and levels briefly along Booth Creek, a useful reprieve before another strenuous push breaks treeline (2.5 miles : 10,165') and crests at the foot of a long, narrow valley (2.85 miles : 10,490').The valley floor and slopes above are thinly wooded, a good place to find wildlife and clear camping terrain. The valley bends northwest on a mild grade beneath craggy, talus strewn walls. Behind you are emerging views of the Holy Cross range and portions of the Vail ski area.The trail moves quickly up-valley through open meadow and thin bands of spruce to the base of a final, steep climb (3.95 miles : 11,120').The trail twists quickly and unevenly through large rock slabs and boulders to a crest, where it drops to the grassy east shore of Booth Lake (4.35 miles : 11,434').Booth Lake is deceptively long with a small island in its center.

264,Buffalo Mountain ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.5,9774,12777,3003,Strenuous,Yes,"  Buffalo Mountain is located in the Eagles Nest Wilderness, a prominent summit over Silverthorne CO with commanding views across South Willow Creek basin, Salt Lick Gulch, Red Peak, Eccles Pass, Red Buffalo Pass and the Gore and Ten Mile ranges.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The Buffalo Mountain Trail is fairly short but strenuous, gaining over 3000' in just 2.75 miles. Portions of the trail negotiate steep switchbacks and rugged talus fields above treeline, which require careful time management and equal exertion on the descent.  Start early for a comfortable pace, and extra time to explore the large summit. Visitors will enjoy long stretches of open tundra, and a good chance to see mountain goat in prime habitat: 	The trail heads northwest on a moderate grade past the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.35 miles : 9,974') to the Buffalo Mountain Trail - South Willow Creek Trail split (.6 miles : 9,993'). 	The Buffalo Mountain Trail bends southwest and steepens on a wide, rocky path past two nondescript cabin remains. It narrows just past the second remain (1.05 miles : 10,355') and begins an arduous climb up steep, tightly wound switchbacks. 	The trail rises quickly into a high subalpine forest, which thins to an abrupt break on the edge of a sprawling talus field (1.7 miles : 11,395'). A large cairn marks this important transition, at which point you'll ignore a false spur to the left and head straight into the rock field. 	Travel slows considerably on a winding, uneven route through the talus. Cairns lead the way, but blend seamlessly with the landscape. Keep track of your progress, avoid deviating from the designated path and pass carefully over loose rock. 	The trail reaches a ridge and bends northwest, where it leaves the talus for a welcome reprieve in the open tundra (2.1 miles : 12,029'). 	While terrain is friendlier the grade is not, curling steeply through open tundra on the mountain's northeast slope. Views include Eccles Pass (11,917'), Red Peak (13,189') and South Willow Creek basin. Look for mountain goat, marmot, ptarmigan and elk in this high alpine environment. 	The trail grows rocky on the final approach to Buffalo Mountain's summit (2.75 miles : 12,777'), which is long, narrow and rugged. Social paths continue south to its bulbous southern tip, a deceptively long and rigorous scramble.  Mountain Goats	Mountain Goats range across North America's northern mountains, with large populations in Idaho, Montana and British Columbia . 	They were introduced to Colorado in 1947 to bolster the state's hunting allure, though debate continues regarding their indigenous status. Mountain Goat live in small groups at high elevations, feeding on alpine tundra grasses, mosses, lichens and sedges. 	Billies can weigh up to 300 pounds, and nannies are somewhat smaller. Both have sharp black horns that can reach 12 inches. Heavily cushioned, skid-proof hooves give them exceptional balance and traction, and double-layered wool coats can withstand extreme weather conditions. 	Since they rarely venture below treeline, they have few natural predators. Avalanches and rocks slides are their primary concern, though eagles are known to knock smaller animals off cliffs, and mountain lion have some success hunting in their lower range.

This short, family-friendly hike leads through a rich montane forest to adjacent lily-covered lakes in the shadow of Buffalo Mountain (12,777'). Visitors will enjoy 3-4 season access, mild grades and several beaver ponds en route to the lake. The trail begins at the south end of the Buffalo Mountain - Lily Pad Lake parking area. Follow the service road up and keep right of the utility station to pick up the trail in a thick lodgepole forest (.15 miles : 9,905'). The path is initially wide, level and softened by pine needles. It moves quickly past the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.3 miles : 9,912') to a large beaver pond on the right. The trail skirts a second pond and passes through a grassy clearing, a good place to look for deer, elk and moose (.75 miles : 9,859'). The grade steepens on a rockier path to the Salt Lick Trail junction (1.1 miles : 10,003'), near which several beaver ponds can be found hidden in the forest. Here the trail levels along its highest point and drops gradually to the edge of Lily Pad Lake #1 (1.55 miles : 9,942'), a small depression blanketed in pond lilies. The trail continues on a high embankment between the first and second Lily Pad Lake (1.6 miles : 9,928'). The second lake is significantly larger, with excellent views north of Buffalo Mountain. Social trails circle each, with access to sandy openings along the main lake's shore that are suitable for fishing. Those seeking a longer outing and a bit more solitude may continue south on the Lily Pad Lake Trail to Meadow Creek and the Meadow Creek Trail junction (2.65 miles : 9,560').

South Willow Creek is soon audible, confirming you're on the right track. Travel eases to a bridge over South Willow Creek (1.65 miles : 9,621') and the Gore Range Trail junction (1.8 miles : 9,678'). 	The Gore Range Trail turns west and rises steadily to the South Willow Falls Trail split (2.35 miles : 10,037'), then steepens away on switchbacks. Avoid spurs that turn back to the creek. 	The trail straightens above a deep, narrow gulch carved by South Willow Creek between Buffalo Mountain (south) and Red Peak (north). It moderates through the gap to a clearing (2.9 miles : 10,405') between the creek and base of a rock slide. 	The trail re-enters timber (3.25 miles : 10,432') and resumes a moderately steep, rugged pace up the south flank of Red Peak. 	The trail bends southwest (4.45 miles : 11,186') in a thinning forest to treeline (4.8 miles : 11,356'). It emerges in a vast alpine bench at the base of a north-south ridge connecting Eccles Pass and Red Buffalo Pass. Excellent camping terrain can be found throughout this area. 	Travel continues on a faint path to a sparingly marked split on the edge of a large alpine pond (5.0 miles : 11,424'). Note that a clear path breaks north from this point - ostensibly the correct route - but it in fact soon fades in the grass. 	To find the correct trail, head northwest over the pond and look for cairns - you'll soon find a clear-cut path that steepens up to Red Buffalo Pass (5.6 miles : 11,742'). 	Views range over South Willow Creek basin and Gore Creek valley.

271,Lincoln Lake ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,10.6,10707,11624,917,Moderate,Yes," Lincoln Lake is located 5.3 miles from Echo Lake Campground in the Mt Evans Wilderness. It lies at treeline in a narrow, rocky bowl on the east side of Rogers Peak (13,391') ringed by large boulders, dense willow and ancient bristlecone pine trees. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Resthouse Trail and Lincoln Lake Trail form a 5.3 mile route that passes through the 700 acre Lincoln Lake burn area and 1076 acre Resthouse Meadow burn area. While the burn areas are ostensibly barren, they're in fact recovering well and full of life. Fire helps maintain natural tree densities while replenishing soils and clearing space for new growth. These newly formed alpine meadows are rife with wildflowers, and provide critical grazing habitat for elk. Bighorn sheep and mountain goat were unaffected by the fire, and thrive above treeline throughout the wilderness area. There are several ways to reach Lincoln Lake, but the most accessible begins at Echo Lake Campground and follows the Resthouse Trail south to the Lincoln Lake Trail. Other routes have seasonal access restrictions, and are partially obstructed by blow-downs related to the fire. Visitors will enjoy contrastingly healthy and skeletal forests, bristlecone pine stands and good wildlife viewing in these newly opened spaces: The trail begins in the campground, where you must complete a free wilderness use permit before setting out. The Resthouse Trail climbs steadily in a thick spruce-fir forest to a crest at .95 miles (11,083'), where it drops 563' in just over a mile to Vance Creek (2.0 miles : 10,520'). The trail pitches up from the creek on variously moderate, steep and rocky intervals. Travel is pleasant if not uneventful until reaching the Lincoln Lake burn area (4.15 miles : 11,278'). The trail levels across ghostly hillsides to the Lincoln Lake Trail (4.65 miles : 11,422'). which breaks west through a reconstituting forest up to Lincoln Lake (5.3 miles : 11,624'). This final segment is rugged and ill-defined as you approach a crest over the lake basin. The way is intuitively followed, even when the trail is not. Steep walls, boulders and uneven terrain make exploration difficult. High points over the outlet offer the best vantage, and a good place to scan for goats and sheep. While trees are usually scarce at this elevation, bristlecone pine around the lake offer a unique aesthetic.

272,Fredonia Gulch to Hoosier Ridge ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,4.0,10250,11451,1201,Moderate,Yes," The Fredonia Gulch Trail provides outstanding views of Summit County and leads to an old mining camp at Hoosier Ridge near the base of Red Mountain.  Moderate to steep grades on a well-maintained service road are nicely suited for conditioned families, runners and winter recreationalists. The trailhead is located 4.5 miles south of downtown Breckenridge on Fredonia Gulch Road (Colorado Road 600).  The trail begins just past a utility building on the right as you enter the forest.  In .1 miles it passes through an official forest service gate labeled CR 600 and climbs steadily through mixed pine with improving westerly views. Massive snowcapped peaks soon emerge behind thick subalpine forests in the foreground. Switchbacks ease through 1.7 miles as the trail bends east and heads directly toward the base of Red Mountain. The remaining .3 miles are rugged and exposed with unabated views to the south and west. Notable summits include (north to south) Crystal Peak (13,852'), Quandary Peak (14,265') and Mt Lincoln (14,286'). The trail ends at an old mining camp on Hoosier Ridge at the base of Red Mountain (2.0 miles : 11,451'). Remnants of mining life still remain, and while exploration is encouraged, caution is a must to avoid stray metal objects hidden by krummholz and underbrush.

273,French Gulch Road to Sallie Barber Mine ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.6,10330,10440,110,Easy-Moderate,Yes," The Sallie Barber Mine is located on the south rim of French Gulch on Barney Ford Hill. The Breckenridge Daily Journal claims the Sallie Barber Mine was established in 1880 by a group of Bald Mountain miners, while The Mining Directory of 1883 shows it was opened in 1882 by G.T. Metzger, a Breckenridge resident.   Both accounts agree it was a small but long-time producer of zinc and other minerals, and an important part of Colorado's Gold Rush era.  The mine site has multiple interpretive signs describing its occupational and operational history, and much of the original mining equipment is on display. From the trailhead, follow French Gulch Road .1 miles north to a split for Sallie Barber Road - Marker 2651.  Bear right downhill through the metal forest service gate, shortly past which the trail - now a groomed service road - crosses a creek, makes a hairpin turn north and climbs toward the mine.  Snowcapped peaks to the west emerge through a healthy pine forest as you gain elevation.  The trail itself is rather uneventful until cresting in a clearing at the Sallie Barber Mine and Historic Site (1.45 miles : 10,728'). Sensational panoramas from the site include Mineral Hill (10,891'), Brewery Hill (11,370'), Humbug Hill (11,031') and Farncomb Hill (11,337').  The trail continues past the mine, descending 1.35 miles through a mixed pine forest to the end of Sallie Barber Road (2.8 miles : 10,440'). ",39.48635,-105.980616666667,100.11666666666666
274,Gold Hill Trail ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,6.6,9219,9989,770,Moderate,Yes," The Gold Hill Trail is located 6.1 miles south of I-70 on Highway 9 between Frisco and Breckenridge. It runs 3.3 miles west to the Peaks Trail, a N-S artery that connects the two towns. The Gold Hill Trail is part of the Colorado Trail, which runs nearly 500 miles from Denver to Durango. Trail Map | Photo Gallery This short segment begins in the Ten Mile Range foothills and passes through a series of clear cuts made in 1988 and 2008 intended to minimize pine beetle infestation and fire. Like many other places in Summit County, pine beetles have dramatically impacted these lodgepole forests, and clearing out affected areas triggers recovery by creating space for new growth. Though large-scale clear cutting may seem anathema to some, it's vital to the long-term health and safety of these mountain forest communities. Young aspen have already taken root while native grasses and brush fill the glades. In fact, the Gold Hill Trail is an excellent place to see wildflowers and elk that are drawn to these new food sources. Despite lacking a true alpine aesthetic, this multiuse trail's moderate grades are ideal for running, biking, families and winter recreation: The trail rises above HWY 9 through a broad open slope with good views across the Ten Mile Range and Breckenridge Ski Area. It climbs steadily into thicker timber and briefly merges with a service road (.95 miles : 9,670'),  then immediately veers left back onto the trail. Keep right at an unmarked fork shortly past the road (1.1 miles: 9,770'). Travel moderates through intervals of clear cuts and thick, uniform lodgepole up to Gold Hill, an unmarked and anticlimactic high point along the trail (2.4 miles : 10,315'). This is a fine stopping point for those with limited time. From Gold Hill, the trail tilts down a steeper grade that winds to the Peaks Trail junction along Miners Creek (3.3 miles : 9,989'). This verdant, marshy area is a good place to find wildlife. From this point, the Peaks Trail runs 6.5 miles south to Breckenridge, and 3.5 miles north to Frisco. Pine Beetles Bark beetles are native insects that under normal conditions help forests cull older trees and make room for new growth. Pine beetles affect trees by laying eggs under the bark, introducing a fungus that reduces overall resistance and blocks water and nutrient transport. Periodic outbreaks have occurred throughout history, however none as severe as this recent epidemic. Cold winters can kill beetle eggs and regulate populations. Unusually hot summers, warm winters and a prolonged dry spell over the region in the last 10 years have led to increased beetle activity while weakening trees natural resistance. While there is no effective way to safely control an outbreak of this magnitude, recent surveys suggest a modest decline in infestations as the availability of healthy trees has declined.

275,Deluge Lake ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,9.1,8721,11746,3025,Strenuous,Yes," Deluge Lake is located 4.55 miles from Gore Creek Trailhead in the Eagles Nest Wilderness north of Vail. It sits above treeline at the head of a broad valley deep in the Gore Range. The Deluge Lake Trail is highlighted by abundant aspen and long stretches of alpine meadow. Visitors will enjoy varied terrain, airy landscapes and well-earned solitude on the challenging hike to Deluge Lake: Trail Map | Photo Gallery The trail rises quickly to the Deluge Lake - Gore Creek Trail split and banks north (.1 mile). It moderates across a grassy slope to a sharp NE turn that begins a long, strenuous climb (.35 miles : 8,778'). The trail is narrowly cut, overgrown in many places and variously rocky and slick with loose sand. Tread carefully along short sections with steep drop-offs. It reaches a break in the aspen and levels across 100 yards of talus (1.35 miles : 9,925'). Steep climbing leads into the subalpine (1.6 miles : 10,265') where grades moderate under a tall spruce-fir canopy (2.0 miles : 10,690'). Look for grouse, elk and bear in this dark and verdant stretch. The trail crests on a high ridge near treeline, but promptly drops back into the forest (2.75 miles : 11,076'). It passes through a large clearing (3.05 miles : 11,007') and undulates down to Deluge Creek with expanding views of the upper valley (3.4 miles : 10,945'). The trail runs up the west bank of Deluge Creek for a short time as another becomes visible along the east bank (3.65 miles : 11,145'). Remain vigilant, as the trail will cross Deluge Creek to the east side at an unmarked point. Find a narrow point to cross and resume steep climbing through the last of treeline. Travel gradually eases across a string of alpine meadows (4.05 miles : 11,325') and makes one final push to a crest that dips on a faint path to Deluge Lake (4.55 miles : 11,746'). The lake vicinity and slopes above are relatively obstacle free and easy to explore. Look for mountain goat along serrated ridgelines framing the valley. Grand Traverse Peak (13,041') caps the Deluge basin's northwest corner, while triangular Snow Peak (13,024') distinguishes the east valley wall. Views down valley include summits from the Ten Mile and Sawatch ranges. Skilled hikers can scale Snow Peak's north saddle and drop to Snow Lake, which has no maintained trail leading to it. A challenging x-country loop can be formed by following Snow Lake's outlet to the Gore Lake Trail, which joins the Gore Creek Trail back to the Gore Creek Trailhead in Vail.

It fills a large basin at treeline beneath Snow Peak (13,024'), Willow Peak (13,357') and Red Peak (13,189'). Trail Map | Photo Gallery The hike to Gore Lake follows Gore Creek 4.2 miles east before breaking north up a steep gulch that levels in a string of alpine meadows below the lake. Gore Lake is compelling for its abundant cutthroat trout, idyllic setting and isolated location deep in the Gore Range:  The Gore Creek Trail heads east through intervals of meadow and aspen, joining Gore Creek briefly over a cascade (.9 miles : 9,075') before edging back up the north valley wall. Travel eases to a bridge (1.8 miles : 9,517'), then undulates ruggedly in dense forest that breaks at a long opening in the valley cleared by avalanches (2.0 miles : 9,521'). Talus and scree along the path were brought down from steep slopes above, now clear of timber and a good place to see wildlife moving about. The trail re-enters dense lodgepole (2.45 miles : 9,733') and moderates to a lazy oxbow in the creek (2.7 miles : 9,802'). Lush grasses, wildflowers and shade highlight this mild segment. The trail steepens to another major clearing (3.2 miles : 9,908'), then eases back into a pristine swath of spruce and fir by the creek (3.5 miles : 9,945'). This next mile offers better fishing access and camping terrain, logistically desirable overnight locations before the strenuous push to Gore Lake or Red Buffalo Pass. The Gore Creek Trail reaches the Gore Lake Trail split at the foot of another opening in the valley and turns sharply north (4.2 miles : 10,194'). It steepens on a twisting climb beside a creek before leveling in a high subalpine forest (4.75 miles : 10,794'). Travel steadies through an expanding alpine landscape where the trail may be faint, washed-out or snow-covered in places. The trail generally favors the gentle west side of the meadow before making a counter -intuitive turn up the steep and cluttered west ridge (5.4 miles : 10,975'). It begins a shifting climb to a large cairn and hairpin turn (right) just below the lake (6.0 miles : 11,341'). A short climb through the last of treeline leads to the SE shore of Gore Lake (6.1 miles : 11,414'). The perimeter and slopes above are easy to explore.

Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The Grays Peak National Recreation Trail scales Stevens Gulch into the upper valley, where it splits for Grays Peak and the saddle between the summits. The following describes clockwise travel to Grays, crosses the saddle to Torreys, and returns by a connector trail to form a lollipop loop:  The trail crosses Stevens Gulch Creek and climbs steadily on a wide, rocky path through the last of treeline. Travel is moderate from .8 miles (11,890') - 1.7 miles (12,245'), a chance to make up time in advance of more demanding sections ahead. 	In 1.7 miles (12,245') the trail steepens up the north side of a divisive ridge in the upper valley; once over it bends east and south again on a more assertive climb into the tundra.The trail curls several times toward the valley-center on a rugged path, pressing steeply in spurts to the split for Grays Peak and Torreys Peak (2.8 miles : 13,273'). 	Bear left toward Grays on a steady, strenuous climb through uneven talus. Though generally well-defined, be mindful of false splits in the indistinguishable rock-scape. These social trail options generally link back to the main, but lead through unnecessarily challenging terrain. 	A sharp east-southeast bend marks the final approach, crossing 14,000' at 3.45 miles. The trail narrows and tightens up a few turns just before leveling on Grays Peak (3.7 miles : 14,270'). 	Look for a Torreys Peak sign on the summit's north side to resume travel. Torreys' conical summit stands .8 miles away across a saddle on the Divide. The trail drops steeply on a rugged, tightly-wound path to the saddle trail connector (4.05 miles : 13,805'). 	Continue past this split to the saddle's lowest point (4.1 miles : 13,757') before turning uphill for Torreys. The trail is considerably narrower and less stable than what led you to Grays, requiring greater attention to footing and other hikers. 	You'll cross 14,000' after 4.4 miles on the final push to Torreys Peak (4.55 miles : 14,267'). Retrace your steps back down the saddle, mindful of sliding rock, drop-offs and other hikers. 	You'll reach the saddle trail connector once again (5.05 miles : 13,805'), this time splitting left down a perennial snowfield on the east side of the Divide. Tread cautiously on this section. 	Once through the trail becomes quite clear (5.15 miles : 13,795'), and falls quickly back to the original split for Grays Peak and Torreys Peak (5.5 miles : 13,273'). 	Continue back down the main trail, which gradually moderates back to the Grays Peak - Stevens Gulch Trailhead to complete the hike (8.35 miles : 11,259').  Grays Peak (14,270') and Torreys Peak (14,267') are the two highest points along the Continental Divide, and considered among the most accessible fourteeners in Colorado. The summits are connected by a .8 mile long saddle, making both attainable in a day with an early start.	The peaks stand over a deep valley framed by Kelso Mountain (13,164') to the north, and Mount Edwards (13,850') and McClellan Mountain's (13,587) serrated ridge to the south.

278,Grouse Lake ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,9.4,7835,10728,2893,Moderate,Yes," Grouse Lake is located 4.7 miles from Grouse Creek Trailhead in the Holy Cross Wilderness. It lies in a wide, level basin ringed by thick timber and marshy willow below Grouse Mountain (12,726'). While the lake aesthetic is limited, the hike itself is compelling. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Grouse Lake Trail closely follows Grouse Creek through grassy aspen groves into thick coniferous forests up to the lake. These aspen groves are especially attractive, coupled with abundant flowers and berries along lower portions of the trail. The kinetic creek offers many good places to camp, and wide oxbows on the lake's outlet are ideal for fishing. The trail is moderate with the exception of two short steep sections and potentially voluminous creek crossings during the runoff: The Grouse Lake Trail heads SW across open grassy slopes to the Grouse Lake - West Grouse Creek Trail split (.55 miles : 8,145'). The Grouse Lake Trail veers left; the West Grouse Creek Trail veers right with access to Waterdog Lake, Olsen Lake and the Turquois Lakes. The Grouse Lake Trail rises through intervals of aspen and mixed pine to a vaguely marked obstruction at 1.0 mile (8,437'). This relatively new re-route forces you (right) across two braids of the creek to the west side of the valley. Note the trail is not immediately obvious until reaching the far side. Once over, travel levels through idyllic aspen groves rife with wildflowers. The trail curls back to the creek, again crossing two successive braids back to the east side of the valley (1.5 and 1.55 miles : 8,745'). The second braid can be a little tricky. The trail climbs steeply up the east side of the creek through uniformly tall and beetle-marred lodgepole. It gradually moderates through 1.9 miles (9,130') to another creek crossing (right) at 2.4 miles (9,430'). The bridge is out, and the ford is difficult with swift water. The trail climbs steeply up the west side of the creek, soon moderating for an extended period in a diverse forest broken by sunny glades and large, open slopes ideal for seeing wildlife. It passes through a large meadow at 3.9 miles (10,240'), and re-enters thick timber with some potentially vague sections ahead. The trail shifts quickly, but in each case is intuitively followed beside the creek up to Grouse Lake (4.7 miles : 10,728'). Grouse Mountain crowns the backdrop of this pleasant but subjectively unspectacular basin. Social trails continue around the lake's west side with ample room for fishing and exploration.

This small lake is ringed by thick timber at the base of a steep ridge, just over which is the Beaver Creek Ski Area. Its open south shore is ideal for camping, with access to a rolling landscape of talus bowls and alpine ridges that see few people.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	While the lake is nondescript, the hike itself is compelling, especially the first two miles through long stretches of flower-studded aspen groves. Olsen Lake comes highly recommended in the fall for its brilliant colors and abundant berries along West Grouse Creek:  The Grouse Lake Trail heads SW across open grassy slopes to the Grouse Lake - West Grouse Creek Trail split (.52 miles : 8,145'). 	The West Grouse Creek Trail veers right to a bridge (1.0 miles : 8,435'), then enters a long stretch of grassy aspen groves beside the creek. Young aspen coupled with the relative absence of mature conifers indicate a recent disturbance that renewed the arboreal cycle. This leafy, food-rich area is a good place to find wildlife. 	The trail climbs steadily to an unmarked split for an old portion of the Meadow Mountain Trail (1.5 miles : 8,793'), and through a young lodgepole forest thinned by a blow-down (2.0 miles). The forest service has done an excellent job clearing the way, though some trees still cross the trail. 	The trail rises in a thicker, healthier forest to a bridge crossing (2.6 miles : 9,481'), past which grades moderate across a long, open slope with good views back at the Gore Range. Note swaths of skunk cabbage in sunny areas along the damp creek bank. 	Grades are variously moderate and steep on a more rugged path through 3.65 miles (10,130'), skirting a few large talus slopes that seem a bit out of place. Pockets of level terrain between the trail and creek are good places to improvise a campsite. 	The trail graduates into a thick, moss-draped subalpine forest up to the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary, where backpackers must self-register (4.7 miles : 10,675'). You'll run just below Waterdog Lake before reaching the boundary, however it's largely concealed by timber. 	Despite great efforts to clear the way, deadfall still spans the trail in several places leading to the Olsen Lake Trail split (approximately 5.05 miles : 10,860'). 	The Olsen Lake Trail breaks west and twists past talus bowls and small ponds, leveling on the final approach to Olsen Lake (5.6 miles : 11,268').

The Abyss Trail begins 20 miles south of Georgetown on Guanella Pass Road, and travels 8.55 miles northeast through the Mt Evans Wilderness to the lake. Trail Map | Photo Gallery While the lake is exceptional, the hike in is equally compelling. Visitors will enjoy pristine valleys, abundant aspen, open alpine travel and excellent backcountry camping en route to Abyss Lake: The trail begins on a steady grade through uniform lodgepole and young aspen (1.0 miles : 10,020'). It crosses south over Scott Gomer Creek (2.15 miles : 10,162') and levels beside it through dense aspen. There are several established campsites on this stretch with great views up-valley. Look for moose in the willow-shrouded creek corridor. The trail crosses back over the creek (3.2 miles : 10,395') and climbs steeply away on a rocky, shifting path to a large, marshy meadow (3.8 miles : 10,682'). The valley opens and forest breaks at the first of two Rosalie Trail splits (4.2 miles : 10,880'). Follow signs to the second Rosalie - Abyss Trail split (4.4 miles : 10,878'). Here the trail becomes steep, faint and obstructed by deadfall. Though brief, this section is difficult to navigate and reclaim the trail once off course. Pay close attention as you progress. Travel moderates in a thinning forest touched by wildfire (5.0 miles : 11,265'), and levels across expanding meadows with many good places to camp (5.5 miles : 11,430'). It weaves through the vestiges of treeline to Helms Lake (11,750' : 6.15 miles), a worthwhile destination in itself. The lake's south slope provides good terrain and tree-cover for backpackers. The trail intuitively skirts the lake, but is enveloped by willow and difficult to follow. You'll likely get wet improvising to the far side where it clarifies on drier ground. The trail continues NE above the lake into open alpine with views of Mt Bierstadt, Mt Evans, and Epaulet Mountain (13,523'). It crosses Lake Fork Creek (7.2 miles : 12,168') and turns sharply NW for the cirque. Short, steep intervals moderate in rolling alpine tundra to Abyss Lake (8.55 miles : 12,650').

It lies above treeline in a broad alpine valley framed by Square Top Mountain (south), and Mount Wilcox (north). Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Silver Dollar Lake Trail continues .5 miles to Murray Lake just below the Continental Divide. Visitors will enjoy open alpine landscapes and excellent fishing at Silver Dollar and Murray lakes: The trail climbs steadily through the vestiges of treeline to a ridge over Naylor Lake (.6 miles : 11,605'), which is private property. Short, steep intervals continue through open tundra to Silver Dollar Lake (1.65 miles : 11,950'). The lake perimeter is generally obstacle-free and easy to explore. Anglers will have ample room and easy access, and backpackers will find soft ground all around the lake. A well defined trail continues steeply over Silver Dollar Lake to Murray Lake (2.15 miles : 12,178'), centered in the upper valley with excellent views of surrounding peaks. Mount Wilcox (13,408') is a challenging but non-technical summit from this point. Square Top Mountain (13,794') is a more ambitious climb, and arguably an easier route is available from Square Top Lakes in the adjacent valley.

Short, steep intervals continue through open tundra to Silver Dollar Lake (1.65 miles : 11,950').The lake perimeter is generally obstacle-free and easy to explore. Anglers will have ample room and easy access, and backpackers will find soft ground all around the lake.A well defined trail continues steeply over Silver Dollar Lake to Murray Lake (2.15 miles : 12,178'), centered in the upper valley with excellent views of surrounding peaks.Mount Wilcox (13,408') is a challenging but non-technical summit from this point. Square Top Mountain (13,794') is a more ambitious climb, and arguably an easier route is available from Square Top Lakes in the adjacent valley.Mountain goat and bighorn sheep inhabit the valley's high walls and ridges, while elk and moose frequent the alpine meadows below. Binoculars are highly recommended on this trail.",39.609566666667,-105.71775,72.58333333333333
284,Lake Constantine ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,7.9,10325,11371,1046,Moderate,Yes,"  Lake Constantine is located 3.95 miles from Tigiwon Road in the Holy Cross Wilderness.

The lake is especially popular among backpackers for its accommodating terrain, excellent fishing and proximity to the Tuhare Lakes, Fall Creek Pass and Seven Sisters Lakes:  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The trail begins on a moderate grade in a heavy spruce-fir forest. It dips at 1.3 miles (10,840') across a steep, open slope with great views of Fall Creek and distant peaks in the Gore Range.   Walk through a stream that bisects the trail at 1.52 miles and resume steady travel past interesting rock features to the Notch Mountain Trail split (2.34 miles : 11,225'). 	The Fall Creek Trail continues SW on mild-moderate undulations to the base of a talus slide and meadow (3.5 miles : 11,240'). It steepens away into the upper valley, where the landscape opens to rolling alpine meadows on the NE corner of Lake Constantine (3.95 miles : 11,371'). 	This large, shapely lake is easy and fun to explore. Social trails circle the area and lead to more private areas and ready-to-use campsites.

285,Notch Mountain Trail ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,10.4,10325,13077,2752,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes," Mount of the Holy Cross (14,005') earned its name and fame when William Henry Jackson photographed a snow-filled couloir that resembled a cross on the peak's NE face in 1873. Adventurers soon followed on the trek to Notch Mountain, which is optimally positioned to view the cross. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The CCC was later commissioned to build Tigiwon Road, the Notch Mountain Trail and Notch Mountain Shelter for visitors expected to make the pilgrimage each year. The Notch Mountain Trail doesn't reach the summit-proper, but leads to the shelter on a saddle just below it (13,077'). This airy expanse offers spectacular views of Mount of the Holy Cross and adjacent peaks on the Holy Cross Ridge. Despite depictions of steep switchbacks on a map, the trail was constructed very well and travel is never too difficult. Visitors will enjoy open alpine landscapes and access to this historic shelter on the Notch Mountain Trail: The trail begins on a moderate grade in a thick subalpine forest. It dips across a steep, open slope with rangy views over Fall Creek and peaks in the Gore and Ten Mile ranges (1.3 miles : 10,840'). It continues through a stream that bisects the trail (1.52 miles) and undulates to the Notch Mountain Trail split (2.34 miles : 11,225'). The Notch Mountain Trail turns away on switchbacks that climb methodically to the edge of treeline. It emerges from the last tall stand of trees across a broad, south-facing slope that supports a brilliant collection of flowers (2.9 miles : 11,650'). The trail climbs steadily on long-leg switchbacks over treeline with expanding views across the valley (3.45 miles : 12,000'). Switchbacks gradually shorten over rockier terrain past 3.95 miles (12,310'). Look for marmot and ptarmigan as you progress, and note the abundance of old-man-of-the-mountain sunflowers and cushion plants between talus slides. The mountain's eponymous 'Notch' is in sight much of the way, but the trail never aims for it. Peaks at the head of Fall Creek and a trio of tarns come in view on the final push to Notch Mountain Shelter (5.2 miles : 13,077').  The shelter is located on a broad saddle with thick tundra grasses that give it a backyard feel. The Holy Cross couloir and peaks of Holy Cross Ridge stand prominently across an unnamed basin. Explore the saddle but remain on rock whenever possible to avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. Continue west along the Halo Ridge to see the Bowl of Tears basin and Cross Creek headwaters.

The upper lake occupies a massive cirque carved from the Holy Cross Ridge, and the lower lake is 275' below in a high alpine terrace. Upper Tuhare Lake (12,365') is notably large for a lake at this elevation. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Fall Creek Trail runs high along the west valley wall before opening in the upper valley at Lake Constantine, past which the Tuhare Lakes Trail splits off on a strenuous climb to the lakes. Visitors will enjoy excellent fishing, scenic waterfalls and imposing alpine backdrops on the hike to the Tuhare Lakes: The trail begins on a moderate grade in a thick subalpine forest. It dips at 1.3 miles (10,840'), the first of several subtle drops that add up on the return. Timber breaks here on a steep slope with good views across Fall Creek and distant peaks in the Gore and Ten Mile ranges. Walk through a stream that bisects the trail at 1.52 miles and resume steady travel past interesting rock features to the Notch Mountain Trail split (2.34 miles : 11,225'). The Fall Creek Trail continues SW on mild-moderate undulations to the base of a talus slide and meadow (3.5 miles : 11,240'). It steepens away into the upper valley where the landscape opens to rolling alpine meadows and Lake Constantine (3.95 miles : 11,371'). Lake Constantine is a compelling destination in itself, with exceptional fishing and ideal camping terrain. The trail fades and splits through damp meadows around the lake, but clarifies on higher ground on the west side.    The trail undulates past Constantine in a thinning forest to the Tuhare Lakes Trail split (4.55 miles : 11,505').  The Tuhare Lakes Trail splits west and clears treeline on a steep, twisting climb beside the lower lake's outlet falls. Some hand-over-hand scrambling is required on this segment. It levels briefly with a great look at the waterfall (4.95 miles), then presses steeply right beside it to Lower Tuhare Lake (5.2 miles : 12,090'). Talus or snow may obscure cairns but the route is fairly obvious. The lake fills a scenic alpine terrace with thick grasses, large boulders and a diverse collection of flowers. The intermittently defined trail continues along the north shore and scales rugged terrain beside the waterfall's upper tier. The falls are spectacular, but avoid adjacent rock slabs that can be perilously slick.   The landscape will naturally funnel you (left) across the top of the waterfall to Upper Tuhare Lake (5.6 miles : 12,365'). Note the route you took, as it may be difficult to retrace. Upper Tuhare Lake is massive, and ringed by jagged 13,000'+ peaks of the Holy Cross Ridge. Scan slopes above for mountain goat and bighorn sheep, which are common in this area.

287,Hanging Lake ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,2.4,6122,7290,1168,Strenuous,No," Hanging Lake fills a 1.5-acre shelf suspended from the walls of Deadhorse Canyon, a side canyon north of Glenwood Canyon and tributary of the Colorado River. The lake is fed by natural springs and the arms of Bridal Veil Falls. Trail Map | Photo Gallery This National Natural Landmark was formed by a geologic fault that caused the lakebed to drop away from the valley floor above. Layers of travertine, accumulating over millennia from dissolved limestone, comprise the lake edge and give the water its turquois color. The lake is the centerpiece of a unique ecosystem that supports equally rare plants and hanging gardens. A strenuous 1.2 mile, 1168' climb follows Deadhorse Creek under a shady canopy to the lake. Hanging Lake is accessed from Exit 125 on I-70 in Glenwood Canyon (see important directions and parking information below). The Hanging Lake Trailhead is located about .4 miles from the parking lot along the Glen Canyon Recreation Path and Colorado River. You must walk/bike the path to reach the trailhead from the parking area: The trail climbs fast on a variously steep and rocky path beside Deadhorse Creek all the way to the lake. The cascading creek is a compelling destination in itself, shaded by oak, cottonwood and pine. Deciduous vegetation, ferns and thimbleberries line this kinetic corridor. The grade eases through .75 miles before a steep push up fence-guarded stone steps leading to boardwalks around Hanging Lake (1.2 miles : 7,323'). Upon reaching the lake, a short spur veers left and above Bridal Veil Falls to Spouting Rock, where water has carved its way through narrow chutes in the limestone wall and joins a powerful waterfall. Visitors have more freedom to explore this area and pass under the falls. Hanging Lake is a rare and fragile ecosystem - rules and regulations are strictly enforced:  It's illegal to swim, wade or fish in the lake.   Dogs are not permitted on the Hanging Lake Trail.   Remain on designated trails and boardwalks at all times.   Small amounts of oil from human skin can dissolve travertine by altering its pH, and the rock itself can easily crack under the weight of footsteps.   Plants in and around the lake are equally sensitive, and should not be stepped upon or handled.

288,Hell's Hole Trail ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.2,9703,11564,1861,Moderate,Yes," The Hell's Hole Trail begins 9.7 miles south of Idaho Springs in the West Chicago Creek Campground. The trail runs 4.1 miles through the Mt Evans Wilderness to a scenic tarn at the head of a wide glacial valley. The seasonal tarn occupies a broad, marshy basin ringed by ancient bristlecone pine trees in a park-like setting. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Visitors will enjoy abundant aspen, diverse wildlife and large bristlecone stands against a high alpine backdrop: The trail begins on a steady climb through tall, arching aspen up to the Mt Evans Wilderness Boundary (.95 miles : 10,280'). Don't forget to fill out the free (but required) registration form shortly past the trailhead. The trail gains 1200' in the first two miles before moderating in a healthy spruce-fir forest (2.0 miles : 10,895'). Expect rocky conditions and a few vague areas higher up. Travel quickens on a level ridge (2 - 2.5 miles) with expanding views across the valley. The forest opens abruptly at treeline with a dramatic look at the full cirque (3.7 miles : 11,410'). Willow mats choke the damp central valley, while the trail edges west and above through open bristlecone stands up to the Hell's Hole Tarn (4.0 miles : 11,537'). The trail simply fades in a clearing just past the tarn and last cluster of trees (4.1 miles : 11,564'). Scan the high slopes for elk, mountain goat and bighorn sheep, all which are common in this area. Challenging but non-technical routes continue up the east wall to Gray Wolf Mountain (13,602'). About Bristlecone Pine Bristlecone pine have unique adaptations to survive persistent winds, high elevation, cold temperatures and short growing seasons:  The bristlecone short, twisted trunk stabilizes the tree, while flexible branches bend in the wind.   Slow growth rates: Bristlecones may take a century to add just 1"" in diameter, and can become nearly dormant during a drought.   Trees replace needles once every 10-15 years rather than annually, which conserves energy.   Narrow growth rings create dense wood that's resistant to insects and disease. The tree's resin also combats insects and disease.   Strip-barking enables a small strip of bark to nourish large branches and needle clusters.

289,Continental Divide Trail: Herman Gulch to Jones Pass ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,17.0,10332,12478,2146,Strenuous,Yes," 	The Continental Divide Trail (CDT) stretches over 3100 miles from Mexico to Canada, 800 miles of which pass through Colorado. 	There are innumerable places to pick up the trail, many within an hour drive of the Denver metro area. One such point is Herman Gulch, located north of Bakerville, CO in the Clear Creek Ranger District of the Arapaho National Forest. 	This segment of the CDT scales two rich drainages up to the Divide, where it runs north at elevations between 12,500' - 13,300' to its next access point at Jones Pass. 	This lengthy and challenging section is positioned well for a two car shuttle, but can be completed in a day with good physical conditioning and cooperative weather. 	Visitors will enjoy miles of open travel at exhilarating heights, unabated panoramas across the northeastern Rockies and diverse wildlife viewing opportunities throughout. 	The Herman Gulch Trail begins on a mild grade through fir and aspen to the Watrous Gulch Trail split and bears north (.17 miles : 10,376'). 	It steepens considerably on a wide, rocky track to Herman Gulch, where it bends NW and moderates along the creek (.5 miles : 10,690'). The trail rises steadily into a long, wide meadow in the lower gulch (1.05 miles : 10,940'). 	The grade relaxes up a widening valley with views of Pettingell Peak (13,553') and Hagar Mountain (13,195'). Look for moose along the willow-lined creek below, and elk on the slopes of Mount Bethel (12,705') to the south. 	Travel is quick while gaining only 300' between the first and second mile (2.0 miles : 11,288'). 	At 2.45 miles (11,464') it edges back into a healthy forest and climbs steeply above the gulch, passing through treeline just before reaching the Jones Pass split (2.85 miles : 11,838'). 	The CDT bends sharply east and glides easily across treeline to a crest separating Herman Gulch from the Woods Creek drainage (3.5 miles : 11,953'). 	Note that a spur branches east from this crest to reach nearby summits, a tempting excursion for those with time, and important navigational mark on the return. 	Here the trail veers NW and drops gently through a transitional landscape across Woods Creek; once over it angles back NE and steepens into the tundra (3.95 miles : 11,878'). 	The trail climbs steadily through open space to a cairn and sharp northwest turn for a strenuous push to the Divide (4.7 miles : 12,408'). 	The triangular summit of Pettingell Peak dominates the foreground as you come upon the Divide and first glimpse down the west side (5.15 miles : 12,807'). 	Another spur peels off to reach Pettingell, but you'll bear north on what become tightly wound switchbacks up to a pointy summit (5.5 miles : 13,143'). 	The trail continues down a short saddle and up to a second summit - the route's highest point (5.75 miles : 13,232'). This is a an ideal turnaround point for those with limited time. 	From the second summit, the trail drops and rises back on a notably rugged path that wraps just below the west side of a third summit. 	Tread carefully through this uneven talus. Once through (6.0 miles : 13,079'), conditions improve considerably on the final 2.5 mile run to Jones Pass. While grades are modest, they're cumulatively taxing at this elevation. Pace yourself, as the return from Jones Pass requires another 1,600' of climbing back to Herman Gulch. 	The trail moves to the Divide's center, dipping and rising along lofty saddles with sensational views in every direction. Hassel Lake (11,335') can be seen immediately down the east slope, backed by countless summits of the Winter Park and James Peak Wilderness Area. 	To the west are panoramas of the Gore Range, and everything in between. Look for ptarmigan, marmot and mountain goat defying the highest ridges as you progress. 	With Jones Pass in sight, the trail passes under power lines (7.8 miles : 12,581') and crosses a short talus field on the west side of a small summit (8.0 miles : 12,621').

290,Herman Lake ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,6.5,10332,11987,1655,Moderate,Yes," Herman Lake (11,987') is located north of Bakerville, CO in the Clear Creek Ranger District of the Arapaho National Forest. It lies at the head of a broad valley in open, rolling tundra just east of the Continental Divide. The Herman Gulch Trail, which is part of the Continental Divide Trail, follows Herman Gulch through scenic meadows to treeline, where it branches off on a well-defined path to Herman Lake. Trail Map | Photo Gallery Visitors will enjoy good trail conditions, open alpine landscapes and a chance to see bighorn sheep and mountain goat in their natural habitat: The Herman Gulch Trail begins in a fir-aspen forest to the Watrous Gulch Trail split and bears north (.17 miles : 10,376'). It steepens on a wide, rocky track to Herman Gulch, where it bends northwest and moderates along the creek and string of slender glades (.5 miles : 10,690'). The trail rises steadily beside the creek into a long meadow in the lower gulch (1.05 miles : 10,940'). Travel moderates with emerging views of the Continental Divide between Pettingell Peak (13,553') and Hagar Mountain (13,195'). Look for moose along the willow-lined creek, and deer and elk on the grassy slopes of Mount Bethel (12,705') to the south. The trail moves quickly up-valley, gaining only 300' between the first and second mile (2.0 miles : 11,288'). At 2.45 miles (11,464') it edges back into forest and climbs steeply above the gulch, passing treeline just before reaching the CDT - Jones Pass Trail split (2.85 miles : 11,838'). Follow signs west to Herman Lake. The Herman Lake Trail climbs steadily into an expansive alpine landscape, easing across open tundra flats to Herman Lake (3.25 miles : 11,987'). Herman Lake is framed by the steep east wall of Pettingell Peak, but is free of major obstacles and easy to explore. The main trail continues past the lake, eventually fading in the tundra on an informal run up to the Divide. Climb knolls over the east shore for panoramas across the basin, and scan valley walls for bighorn sheep and mountain goat which inhabit this area.

It lies just above treeline surrounded by grassy slopes, large boulders and krummholz-topped knolls.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The Lonesome Lake Trail follows East Fork Homestake Creek through large meadows with slow oxbows and rich habitat for wildlife. Sunny glades throughout support a full spectrum of flowers, and give it an airy feel. 	Most hikers in this area head for Missouri and Fancy lakes, and overlook this attractive destination. Visitors will enjoy great camping and lighter crowds at Lonesome Lake:  The trail rises quickly past the dam to a crest, then drops to a skinny, elevated bridge over the creek (.65 miles : 10,340'). Crossing in the water may be easier/safer if wet or with a heavy pack. 	Travel moderates up the west side of the creek to the first of three large meadows (1.5 miles : 10,455'). This damp, diversely vegetated area is a great place to see wildlife and fish oxbows in the center. 	The trail runs through open space before undulating away in the forest. It's possible to stay in the meadow and follow a social track across, knowing at some point you'll need to improvise back. 	The main trail reaches a high point at the far end of the meadow (2.25 miles), and resumes mild-moderate undulations through bands of timber and glades. It drops to a second meadow and toggles between the forest and open space (2.7 miles : 10,585'). You may continue in this meadow as well, but terrain is more uneven and cluttered than the first. 	Grades steepen past the second meadow on a variously faint, shifting and rooted path (3.5 miles : 10,725'). Travel is still generally moderate to a third meadow (4.55 miles : 11,225'), at the far end of which is a steep slope that you'll scale through treeline into a postcard-like setting. 	The trail loses clarity in places, but is intuitively followed up-valley to Lonesome Lake (5.2 miles : 11,571'). Rolling meadows, ponds, pockets of krummholz and large boulders surround the lake, offering privacy and fun nooks to explore. 	Scale slopes for an aerial view of the basin, and continue all the way to a low ridge on the Continental Divide, where you can peer down on Timberline Lake in a large cirque near Leadville CO.

Trail Map | Photo Gallery  Mirror Lake is arguably the most challenging of the group, located 1.65 miles past the split for Upper Cataract Lake in a rugged landscape. Visitors will enjoy access to numerous lakes and deep backcountry scenery on the hike to Mirror Lake: 	The Surprise Trail rises steadily through aspen-studded hillsides on a S-SE heading to the Eagles Nest Wilderness Boundary (.27 miles : 8,725'). It passes through a large aspen grove (.8 miles) to a stream and makeshift bridge (1.0 mile : 9,135'); once over it steepens beside a long, slender meadow. 	Though badly marred by pine beetle, deadfall has cleared space for new growth and verdant ground cover.

McCullough Gulch is a deservingly popular trail, especially among anglers and active families. Arrive early to secure parking and avoid crowds. 	Upper Blue Reservoir is the first of several accessible lakes in the McCullough Creek drainage. A challenging but reasonably well-defined route continues into the capacious upper valley, where intuitive routing through expansive alpine meadows leads to over six additional lakes and tarns:  The trail begins on a steep mining road that rises along the creek to a fork, where you'll veer left onto a rocky, rooted path (.5 miles : 11,440'). It shifts frequently and braids in several places, however signs provide ample guidance. 	The trail crosses a short talus field at .95 miles (11,580'), just past which are consecutive splits for the White Falls Loop (1.0 miles : 11,597'). This short excursion leads to good views of the falls and returns to the main trail. 	Travel continues steeply through treeline to an unmarked fork (1.3 miles); go left to reach the lake's outlet area, or keep straight to the north shore (1.35 miles : 11,915'). Those with time should explore both access points, as they lead to different views of this deceptively long and shapely lake. 	To reach the upper valley, follow the main trail along the north shore. It undulates ruggedly over outcrops and several marshy inlet streams to the far west side (1.6 miles : 12,006'), where you'll begin a steep, twisting climb that generally traces the lake's main inlet falls. 	Though at first obfuscated by brush, the route clarifies and is well-marked by cairns once you get going. Look for mountain goat along the way, which are fairly common in this area. 	The landscape naturally funnels you to the top of the waterfall, where it suddenly levels by a tarn and opens dramatically in the upper valley (2.1 miles : 12,415'). 	The path continues west and eventually fades in open tundra, but it's hardly necessary at this point. The first lake is located straight ahead at about 2.55 miles (12,555'). 	It's fairly easy to navigate by sight up to the lake just behind it, which lies in a deep cirque that's typically iced-over through mid-summer (3.15 miles : 12,785'). 	The McCullough Gulch Trail is located 2.2 miles west of Highway 9 on the north side of Quandary Peak.

297,Wheeler Trail to Mohawk Lakes ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,8.3,10975,12073,1098,Moderate-Strenuous,Yes,"  Mohawk Lake is located 4.15 miles from McCullough Gulch via the Wheeler National Recreation Trail, which stretches over 10 miles S-N across the Ten Mile Range. 	Though most hikers access Mohawk Lake from Spruce Creek Trailhead, this longer alternative enjoys light crowds and additional wildlife viewing opportunities on the steep up-down traverse between the McCullough Gulch and Spruce Creek drainages.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The Wheeler Trail joins the Spruce Creek Trail after 2.3 miles, which turns west past Continental Falls, historic mining cabins and Lower Mohawk Lake to Mohawk Lake.  An unimproved route continues above Mohawk Lake through expansive alpine meadows to five more spectacular lakes in the upper valley: 	The Wheeler Trail begins on the north side of McCullough Gulch with a terrific look at Quandary Peak (14,265'), the tallest peak in the Ten Mile Range. 	It climbs steeply through a patchy subalpine forest along an east-facing slope to a crest (.55 miles : 11,503'), where grades moderate with good views of the Boreas Pass area. 	The trail drops gradually then steeply into a thick spruce-fir forest leading to the Spruce Creek Trail split on the edge of a large marshy meadow (2.3 miles : 10,965'). 	The Spruce Creek Trail turns west beside the meadow up to Spruce Creek Road, (2.8 miles : 11,120'), which you'll follow to its terminus at a water utility station. Cross the dam and follow signs (right) off the road to resume the trail (2.9 miles). 	Travel steepens to the Mayflower Lakes split (3.15 miles : 11,285') and crosses a creek, past which the trail braids in several places. These social trails typically lead to views of Continental Falls, mining remains or established campsites - and in most cases link back to the main trail artery. Do your best to stay on track, and avoid trampling sensitive vegetation. 	The trail twists steeply by a mining cabin to a marked split for Lower Continental Falls Vista (3.35 miles : 11,385'). It follows a useful mining cable past the falls split up open rock, moderating to the edge of Lower Mohawk Lake (3.75 miles : 11,810'). 	Lower Mohawk Lake lies at treeline below Mount Helen (13,164'), a fine stopping point if limited by time or weather. Continental Falls pour from its outlet, and there's plenty of shoreline to explore. 	The trail continues along the shore before breaking away on a twisting (and braided) climb through treeline to Mohawk Lake (4.15 miles : 12,073'). 	Mohawk Lake fills a large circular bowl with scalable walls and a tight but navigable shoreline. Large cutthroat trout are abundant, and you'll likely find anglers ringing the lake. 	A well-traveled route continues up Mohawk's north side into the dramatically wide upper valley, capped by Pacific Peak (13,950'), Crystal Peak (13,852') and Father Dyer Peak (13,615'). 	It skirts a small lake (4.35 miles : 12,219') and continues across relatively flat open tundra to three more - 4.7 miles (12,334'), 5.05 miles (12,372') and 5.35 miles (12,438'). A fifth - Pacific Tarn - requires a steep, rocky climb with no discernable route past the fourth lake.

Eccles Pass straddles a divisive ridge between the Meadow Creek drainage (south), and South Willow Creek basin (north).  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  This high vantage provides commanding views across each, and distant peaks of the Gore and Ten Mile ranges. After a steady climb through dense forest, the landscape opens across stunning alpine meadows leading up to Eccles Pass: 	The Meadow Creek Trail winds through an aspen-pine forest to the Lily Pad Lake Trail split and bends northeast (.57 miles : 9,560'). It widens on a variously soft and rocky path through columns of lodgepole to Meadow Creek (1.35 miles : 10,036'), resuming a methodical climb once across. 	At 2.5 miles (10,764') the trail narrows in a transitional forest where lodgepole give way to spruce and fir in the high subalpine. The forest briefly opens with a glimpse of the upper valley (2.65 miles : 10,835'), and presses steeply to a crest over the first of three large meadows (2.95 miles : 10,988'). 	The trail drops and undulates ruggedly up the wooded south edge of the first and smallest meadow, crossing Meadow Creek once on a makeshift bridge. Large side pools in the vicinity are particularly good for angling. 	The thinning forest breaks on the edge of a second, much larger meadow with a revealing look at the entire upper valley (3.6 miles : 11,128'). Chief Mountain (11,377') stands prominently to the south, and Eccles Pass can now be seen to the northwest. 	This terrain is ideal for camping, though fire regulations near treeline now apply (see guidelines below). The trail levels into the third and largest meadow (3.95 miles : 11,235'), which leads back over Meadow Creek (4.15 miles : 11,305'). 	The path is intermittently faint but intuitively followed to the Meadow Creek - Gore Range Trail junction (4.45 miles : 11,422'), with Eccles Pass clearly visible in the northwest corner of the valley. 	The Gore Range Trail bears right and winds steeply up to Eccles Pass (5.12 miles : 11,918') with exceptional views down Meadow Creek valley, and north across Red Peak (13,189'), Buffalo Mountain (12,777') and South Willow Creek basin. 	The Gore Range Trail drops from Eccles Pass and continues north to Red Buffalo Pass (11,742'), a major east-west route between Silverthorne and Vail. 	Those with time should consider this relatively short excursion (about 3 miles roundtrip), which runs across gorgeous alpine benches and by several small lakes to the pass.

Visitors will enjoy miles of alpine travel and abundant wildflowers on this challenging and varied trek:  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The Meadow Creek Trail winds through an aspen-pine forest to the Lily Pad Lake Trail split and bends northeast (.57 miles : 9,560'). It widens on a variously soft and rocky path to Meadow Creek (1.35 miles : 10,036'), crosses, and resumes a methodical climb through uniform lodgepole.  At 2.5 miles (10,764') the trail transitions into the high subalpine with a glimpse of the upper valley (2.65 miles : 10,835'). It continues steeply to a crest overlooking the first of three large meadows below Eccles Pass (2.95 miles : 10,988'). 	Look for moose and elk in the meadows, and mountain goat on higher slopes and ridges.

It fills a steep-walled bowl at treeline, and is one of many highlights on the Missouri Pass - Fancy Pass Loop. Trail Map | Photo Gallery The Fancy Creek Trail rises quickly in a moss-draped forest to the lake, and continues on a challenging .7 mile, 888' climb to Fancy Pass (12,390'). While the Fancy Lake basin is more confined than the Missouri Lakes basin, backpackers will enjoy privacy among knolls that ring the lake, and in thick forests just below it: The trail crosses the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (.2 miles) and undulates to Zen Bridge over Fancy Creek (.85 miles : 10,445'). The bridge is elevated and can be slippery; in some cases it may be easier/safer to cross in the water. Here it begins a steady climb through a pleasant (if nondescript) forest to a large clearing and vaguely marked creek crossing (2.18 miles : 11,145'). The trail closely follows the creek to this point, but is largely concealed by timber. It crosses the creek and steepens considerably on a corkscrew-like path to the open east shore of Fancy Lake (2.7 miles : 11,540'). Note portions of the trail can be faint on this final approach. Fancy Lake is fairly walled-in, but social trails lead around the bowl to interesting nooks and tall knolls. The trail twists past the lake and crosses back over the creek to the Holy Cross City Trail split (2.8 miles : 11,560'). The Fancy Creek Trail clears treeline on a steep climb into the tapered upper valley. Even if not aiming for the pass, it's worth reaching this point for great aerial views of the lake. The trail is funneled into a narrow, boulder-lined chute below jagged crags to Fancy Pass (3.4 miles : 12,390'). Snow can make this strenuous approach even more difficult; traction devices are often useful. Views from the pass, a small notch on the south end of the Holy Cross Ridge, are stunning. The trail drops from the pass into the Treasure Vault Lake basin and joins the Missouri Lake Trail to form an 8.8 mile loop. Fancy Lake (11,540') is located 2.7 miles from Homestake Road in the Holy Cross Wilderness. It fills a steep-walled bowl at treeline, and is one of many highlights on the Missouri Pass - Fancy Pass Loop.Trail Map | Photo GalleryThe Fancy Creek Trail rises quickly in a moss-draped forest to the lake, and continues on a challenging .7 mile, 888' climb to Fancy Pass (12,390').

302,Missouri Lakes ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,7.0,10010,11502,1492,Moderate,Yes," 	The Missouri Lakes are located 3.5 miles from Homestake Road in the Holy Cross Wilderness. They occupy an idyllic alpine basin below Missouri Pass (11,986') in the heart of the Sawatch Range.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	The lakes sit at and just above treeline in a gentle expanse dotted with ponds, streams and tree-topped knolls. The area's mild terrain is ideal for camping, fishing and extended exploration.  The Missouri Lakes are deservingly one of the most popular destinations in the Holy Cross, and highlight the venerable Missouri Pass - Fancy Pass Loop: 	The trail begins on a mild grade that steepens past .5 miles to a wide section of creek at the Holy Cross Wilderness Boundary (.93 miles : 10,360'). It narrows in a thick forest up to a bridge over the creek (1.1 miles : 10,468'), where you can divert to a series of scenic cascades just upstream. 	Grades pick up considerably past the bridge along the rim of a deep, narrow gorge. Exercise caution when viewing the creek from above on these deceptively slippery rock slabs. 	The trail crosses back over the creek (1.35 miles) and levels around a large, marshy meadow with views of Savage Peak and a diverse collection of flowers (1.5 miles : 10,805'). 	It circles the meadow and funnels into the upper gorge right along the creek (2.0 miles : 10,987'), then moderates away in a thinning subalpine forest (2.5 miles : 11,170'). 	Look for a sparingly marked social trail between 2.7-2.8 miles that veers SW (left) along a creek to the first Missouri Lake. This is a compelling destination that few visitors see, and great choice for backpackers on busy weekends. 	The main trail continues on variously rugged and moderate intervals into the upper valley where the landscape opens to Lower Missouri Lake (3.15 miles : 11,410').

Views from the pass are stunning, highlighted by Treasure Vault Lake, Blodgett Lake and distant Middle Mountain ridge. The trail drops quickly off the pass through high alpine meadows to the Cross Creek Trail - Fancy Creek Trail junction (4.7 miles : 11,802').  Treasure Vault Lake is an easy .4 mile roundtrip excursion, but be mindful of time and weather with one more pass to climb. Also note that trails may be faint leading to and past the intersection; a good map and understanding of the route will help avoid confusion. The Fancy Creek Trail turns toward Fancy Pass, a rocky notch in the NE corner of the basin. It rises gently across rolling slopes, then steepens over talus up to Fancy Pass (5.45 miles : 12,390'). Views once again are exceptional, with a chance to survey the markedly steeper descent into the Fancy Creek drainage. The drainage is quite different from the Missouri side, notably narrower, deeper and topped by rugged crags.

306,Mt Goliath Natural Area ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,2.8,11540,12132,540,Easy-Moderate,Yes," 	The Mt Goliath Natural Area is located 16.5 miles south of Idaho Springs on the Mt Evans Scenic Byway. It protects the largest, northernmost stand of Bristlecone Pine trees in North America, and is internationally recognized as one of the purest locations to study alpine ecology.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  The bristlecone of Mt Goliath are found in large quantities because of conducive conditions on dry, south-facing slopes over 11,000'. They include some of the oldest trees in Colorado, ranging from 1600 to 2500 years old. 	Bristlecone pine have unique adaptations to survive the alpine tundra's persistent winds, high elevation, low moisture, cold temperatures and short growing seasons:  		The bristlecone pine's short, twisted trunk facilitates nutrient flow, and stabilizes the tree in strong winds (vs. a long, narrow trunk that could snap).   		Flexible branches bend in the wind, rather than break.   		Slow growth rates: Bristlecones may take a century to add just 1 inch in diameter, and can become nearly dormant during a drought.   		Trees replace needles once every 10-15 years rather than annually, which conserves energy.   		Narrow growth rings create dense wood that's resistant to insects and disease. The tree's resin also combats insects and disease.    Strip-barking enables a small strip of bark to nourish large branches and needle clusters.  	Lack of nutrient competition and the absence of fire also contribute to the trees' longevity. 	While bristlecone pines highlight this area, it also supports localized micro-climates with plants found nowhere else below the Arctic Circle - one would have to travel 3,000 miles north to see the same plant communities. 	The Pesman Trail runs 1.4 miles and climbs 592' through these distinct plant communities and the heart of the bristlecone pine forest. 	The Bristlecone Loop and Alpine Loop offer short extensions through the forest and open tundra (respectively). Mountain goat, bighorn sheep, elk, marmot, ptarmigan and various raptors can be seen throughout the year.  Plants of the Alpine Tundra 	Alpine tundra plants grow close to the ground to minimize wind exposure, have small fleshy leaves with waxy surfaces to facilitate water conservation, often have hairy leaves for additional warmth, and sometimes have red stems to prevent sunburn. 	They're also perennials, which use the same root system each year. Some, like the Spring Beauty, entrench themselves in rocky crevices and grow a long, thick taproot to stabilize the plant and access moisture deep underground. 	Lichens are comprised of two organisms: a fungus that gives it structure, and an algae within the fungus that stores water and gives it color. Lichens need only a rock, sunlight, and some water every few years to survive. 	A one inch diameter lichen may be hundreds of years old; some lichens can live for thousands of years. Lichens help turn rock into soil by secreting acids that dissolve it into minerals. 	Cushion and mat plants help build soil by capturing organic debris in their foliage, plots in which grasses and taller plants can eventually root. This turns fellfield into alpine turf, a process that can take centuries. 	The Mt Goliath Natural Area is located 16.5 miles south of Idaho Springs on the Mt Evans Scenic Byway.

Quandary Peak is the highest point in Colorado's Tenmile Range, and 13th among the state's 14ers.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery 	It's considered among the easiest 14ers to reach for its modest distance and well built trail. Still, the 3300' climb in just 3.1 miles is no small task, and rocky terrain will challenge even the fittest hikers.  Visitors will enjoy exceptional views that extend across the Mosquito, Gore and Sawatch ranges: 	The trail climbs steadily across two marked jeep roads to your first glimpse of Quandary Peak, Hoosier Pass, and distant peaks of the Tenmile Range (.85 mile - 1.0 mile). It clears treeline and wraps to the south face of Quandary Peak's east ridge (1.0 miles : 11,721'). 	Here you'll have views of the Blue Lakes, Monte Cristo Creek and North Star Mountain looming high on the Continental Divide. The relatively even, dirt path to this point transitions to rugged talus on a steep, winding climb up the southeast flank of Quandary Peak (1.25 miles : 11,975'). 	Climbing intensifies to Quandary's well-defined E-W spine. The trail blends easily into the landscape, but is well-marked by cairns and intuitively followed when not. It levels briefly along the east ridge across a wide tundra bench at the base of Quandary Peak (2.15 miles : 13,102'). 	Here you'll have big views down McCullough Gulch, south across the Continental Divide and due west up the formidable and final summit push. Look for mountain goat along nearby ridges, and moose and elk in the adjacent valleys. 	At 2.3 miles (13,168') the path narrows and steepens considerably on a tightly wound, rocky path headed directly for the summit. Those with a later start will likely face a good deal of downhill traffic. 	Methodical climbing over variously large and loose talus crosses 14,000' (2.9 miles) and relaxes on the final steps to the summit (3.1 miles : 14,265'). 	Views from the summit are awesome, particularly across the upper drainage and half dozen unnamed lakes in McCullough Gulch. To the west are jagged peaks and ridges that perpendicularly meet Quandary's west ridge and define the Continental Divide, Monte Cristo and McCullough drainages. 	Nearby 14ers include Mt Lincoln (14,291'), Mt Bross (14,172'), and Mt Democrat (14,152'). Peer down the Cristo Couloir - defined as a steep gorge or gully on the side of a mountain - a celebrated winter route to the summit that begins from Blue Lake. 	The summit is large enough for weekend crowds, but with limited room to explore. Take a few steps west from the summit to find a small wind shelter along a rugged, tapering ridge.

314,Mayflower Lakes ,summit-county-eagle-county-clear-creek-county,5.2,10390,11365,975,Moderate,Yes," The Mayflower Lakes are located high above Breckenridge at 11,365' along the Spruce Creek Trail. While there is one main body of water, the name's plurality comes come various tarns - or glacial pools - and small water pockets near the lake's main outlet.  The Spruce Creek Trail is open to hiking, fishing, backpacking, mountain biking and winter recreation, but no motorized vehicles are allowed.   The trail heads west over Spruce Creek (.1 miles) and climbs steadily through a mix of lodgepole, aspen and Engelmann spruce for 1.4 miles to the Wheeler Trail junction (1.5 miles : 10,974'), also known as the Wheeler National Recreation Trail.  The landscape opens considerably past the split in a large, marshy meadow with impressive views of Mt Helen (13,164').   Look for deer, elk, moose and grouse in this food-rich habitat.  Visitors are encouraged to admire the fragile marsh ecosystem from its edge and avoid treading on sensitive vegetation. The trail skirts the meadow, re-enters the forest and climbs .6 miles to a clearing at an intersection with Spruce Creek Road and two green utility sheds (2.1 miles : 11,151').  It runs into the dam of a small reservoir about 100 yards past the utility sheds and veers right toward signs for Mayflower and Mohawk Lakes.  It resumes in a thinning forest past mining and homestead ruins (2.5 miles : 11,331') to the edge of Mayflower Lakes (2.6 miles : 11,365'). Close examination reveals a single body of water flanked by numerous outlying ponds to the east, a collection of disjointed pools rather than a second 'formal' lake.  Those wanting a longer, more arduous adventure should consider hiking past Mayflower Lakes to Lower Mohawk Lake (11,861') and Upper Mohawk Lake (12,110'). ",39.437266666667,-106.0505833333333,100.5

Trail Map | Photo Gallery  Those with time may divert to nearby Mayflower Lakes, or continue past Mohawk Lake through open tundra to a string of 5 alpine lakes and tarns in the upper valley: 	The trail heads west over Spruce Creek (.1 miles) and climbs steadily through aspen, fir and spruce for 1.4 miles to the Wheeler Trail split on the edge of a large, marshy meadow (1.5 miles : 10,965'). This is a good place to break and look for wildlife, epsecially moose and elk. 	The Spruce Creek Trail turns west beside the meadow up to Spruce Creek Road, (2.0 miles : 11,120'), which you'll follow to its terminus at a water utility station. Cross the dam and follow signs (right) off the road to pick up the trail (2.1 miles : 11,151'). 	Travel steepens to the Mayflower Lakes split (2.35 miles : 11,285') and crosses a creek, past which the trail braids in several places. 	These social trails typically lead to views of Continental Falls, mining remains or established campsites - and in most cases link back to the main trail artery. Look for cairns to stay on track and do your best to avoid crosscutting sensitive vegetation. 	The trail twists steeply by a mining cabin to a marked split for Lower Continental Falls Vista (2.55 miles : 11,385'). It follows a useful mining cable past the falls split up steep open rock to the edge of Lower Mohawk Lake (2.95 miles : 11,810'). 	Lower Mohawk Lake lies at treeline below Mount Helen (13,164'), a fine stopping point if limited by time or weather. Continental Falls pour from its outlet, and there's plenty of shoreline to explore. 	The trail continues along the shore before breaking away on a steep, twisting climb through treeline to Mohawk Lake (3.35 miles : 12,073'). The trail braids again in several places on this final push, however intuitive travel leads uphill in each instance. 	Mohawk Lake fills a large, steep-walled bowl with great views back down valley of Lower Mohawk Lake and Mt Helen. A tight but navigable shoreline offers anglers plenty of room to cast, though exploration is somewhat limited by pitch. 	Scale the lake's north wall to pick up an intuitively followed social trail into the upper valley, which opens dramatically below Pacific Peak (13,950'), Crystal Peak (13,852') and Father Dyer Peak (13,615'). 	The route skirts a small lake directly above Mohawk (3.55 miles : 12,219') and continues across relatively flat open tundra to three more - 3.9 miles (12,334'), 4.25 miles (12,372') and 4.55 miles (12,438').

It's named after Edwin James, a physician and botanist who was among the first to catalogue plants of the Rocky Mountains. There are several ways to reach James Peak, each with unique attractions and challenges.  Trail Map | Photo Gallery  The following description begins at the St Mary's Glacier Trailhead and follows an unofficial but well-defined route to the Continental Divide Trail, which continues up to the summit: 	The trail begins on a wide, rocky forest road heading northwest. Keep left of all offshoots, and within clearly drawn property lines on each side of the road. 	The road-trail rises quickly through a high subalpine forest that breaks suddenly across a bridge across the outlet of St Mary's Lake (.45 miles : 10,738'). Note bristlecone pine in the area, a species adapted to high altitudes and extreme weather conditions. 	The trail is somewhat ill-defined but intuitively followed along the NE shore toward the snow field. It narrows on a clearer path through dense willows and emerges on the north shore just below the snowfield. A few steps off-path leads to the base of St Mary's Glacier (.75 miles : 10,848'). 	The trail continues up the north side of the glacier over churned rocks and soil pushed to its margins by the annual growth and recession of the snow mass. 	Footing can be tricky, and depending on the time of year, you may very well need to walk directly on the glacier. A well-defined path soon appears on the glacier's south side, where you'll ultimately need to be - cross the glacier at a convenient point and resume travel beside it. 	The snowfield tapers up a narrow gulch to its top (1.1 miles : 11,236'), where the path levels on the edge an immense tundra flat. James Peak (right) and Mount Bancroft (left) emerge on the western horizon, while Grays Peak (14,270') and Torreys Peak (14,267') stand out to the south. 	Travel eases considerably through the open flat on a westerly heading toward James Peak, crossing a Jeep-ATV road at 2.0 miles (11,641'). 	Though the trail disappears once over the road, a number of trail markers about 75 yards away - clearly visible in the open tundra - will connect you back to it. Improvise your way to the markers and continue west on a well-cut path toward James Peak. The trail moves quickly through an expanding landscape to the base of James Peak, where it bends south and steepens up its east face (2.5 miles : 11,818'). 	The trail soon merges at a cairn - but otherwise unmarked point - with the Continental Divide Trail (2.8 miles : 12,020'). This is an important point, as you'll need to recognize this split on the return. 	The trail grows intermittently rocky and steep on a winding course up the mountain's east face, but seldom too much of one or the other to slow travel. It briefly straightens on a westerly heading, edging close to the deep chasm between Mount Bancroft (13,250') and James Peak (3.0 miles : 12,195'). 	Views of Ice Lake emerge in a spectacular cirque between the adjacent peaks, and with a few steps off trail, down the entire Loch Lomond drainage (see photo gallery). 	The trail skirts a perennial snowfield (3.4 miles : 12,535') and gradually bends northwest up a broad slope with views of James Peak Lake, Little Echo Lake and the Mammoth Gulch drainage in the northern valley below (3.8 miles : 12,880'). A final push over two false summits levels on the large summit of James Peak (4.15 miles : 12,295'). 	The summit area is large, flat and easy to explore. Maneuver about for a revealing look down the Loch Lomond and Mammoth Gulch drainages, and over the vast tundra flat through which you traveled to reach the base of James Peak.
